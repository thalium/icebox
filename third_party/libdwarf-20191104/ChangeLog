2019-11-05 David Anderson
     * configure.ac: Version 20191104
     * configure: Regenerated
2019-11-04 David Anderson
     * Makefile.am: Removed inproper SUBDIRS if clauses.
     * Makefile.in: Regenerated.
     * configure.ac: Removed dist-xz frm AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE
       as we don't use it and MacOS command line tools
       do not have xz.
     * configure: Regenerated.
2019-10-23 David Anderson
     * CMakeLists.txt: Create a separate compile options
       list DW_FWALLXX from C DW_FWALL.
2019-10-22 David Anderson
     * configure.ac:   Package Version 20191022.
     * configure: regenerated.
     * CMakeLists.txt: Package Version 20191022.
       Revised the settings so PACKAGE_VERSION winds up
       in string quotes in config.h.
     * config.h.in.cmake: Revisions so PACKAGE_VERSION winds up 
       in string quotes in config.h.
2019-10-21 David Anderson
     * configure.ac : Added additional AC_CHECK_HEADERS.  
       Version 20191021
     * config.h.in, configure: Regenerated
2019-10-18 David Anderson
     * CMakeLists.txt: Code the isBigEndian test correctly.
     * config.h.in.cmake: Code the #cmakedefine for WORDS_BIGENDIAN
2019-10-16 David Anderson
     * configure.ac: The use of AC_C_BIGENDIAN was incorrect
       and a revised use works properly so config.h 
       has WORDS_BIGENDIAN when it should.
     * configure: regenerated.
     * config.h.in: regenerated.
2019-10-14 David Anderson
     * CMakeLists.txt: Corrected the cmake version of
       a couple tests so they work.
     * configure.ac: Now version 20191014.
     * configure: Regenerated.
2019-10-02 David Anderson
     * README.cmake: Updated and improved the comments
       about ctest. ctest now tests that dwarfdump
       and libdwarf basically work (as well as
       testing internal interfaces).
2019-10-02 David Anderson
     * configure.ac: Now version 20191002
     * configure: regenerated. Version 20191002
2019-10-01 David Anderson
     * configure.ac: Now version 20190929
     * configure: regenerated. Version 20190929
2019-09-19 David Anderson
     * configure.ac: Now version 20190919
     * configure: regenerated. Version 20190919
2019-07-05 David Anderson
     * dwarf_elf_load_headers.c(read_gs_section_group): The
       check for an invalid gh_entsize of an SHT_GROUP
       secion was done too late.
       Now the check is before using the value (avoiding
       a divide-by-zero error).
2019-06-04 David Anderson
     * CMakeLists.txt,config.h.in.cmake,configure.ac:
       No longer reference inttypes.h or HAVE_INTTYPES_H
       as we do not refer to anything in that C99 include file.
     * configure: regenerated. Version 20190604
2019-05-29  David Anderson
    * CMakeLists.txt, configure.ac: Version 20190529
    * configure: regenerated.
2019-05-24  David Anderson
    * CMakeLists.txt: Ensure there is a reasonable
      definition of uintptr_t even if stdint.h missing.
    * Makefile.am:Add config.h.in.cmake to the list
      of files. 
    * Makefile.in:Regenerate
    * config.h.in: Add HAVE_INTPTR_T and intptr_t.
    * config.h.in.cmake: Add the 1 to several HAV_*
      config variables that lacked it.
    * Add PACKAGE_NAME etc via cmakedefine.
    * configure.ac: Add AC_TYPE_INTPTR_T, add comments
      about the *INTPTR_T stuff.
    * configure: Regenerated.
    * scripts/buildandreleasetest.sh. Add --nodwarfgen
      option to enable building with no stdint.h
      (c++ finds the #define of uintptr_t useless).
2019-05-22  David Anderson
    * CMakeLists.txt: check_include_file( "sys/elf_386.h" 
      and check_include_file( "stdint.h" both had badly
      spelled (erronous) target variables.
2019-05-21  David Anderson
    * CmakeLlists.txt: The generator expression was unnecessary
      and is no longer used, instead a simple list variable
      is named DW_FWALL.
2019-05-20  David Anderson
    * CmakeLlists.txt: Now generates config.h at top binary level.
    * config.h.in.cmake: New, now the only config.h.in present
2019-05-20  David Anderson
    * CmakeLists.txt: The checks for elf64_getehdr and
      elf64_getshdr were written incorrectly.
      The library options changed to be consistent
      with standard practice:
      nonshared->BUILD_NON_SHARED
      shared->BUILD_SHARED
      wall->WALL (and the option generator expression corrected)
      nonstandardprintf->HAVE_NONSTANDARD_PRINTF_64_FORMAT
      HAVE_CUSTOM_LIBELF (new, not of general interest)
      dodwarfexample->BUILD_DWARFEXAMPLE
      dodwarfgen->BUILD_DWARFGEN
      test->DO_TESTING
      Version 20190520
    * README.cmake: updated to match the new option names,
    * appveyor.yml: Updated to match cmake new option names.
    * config.h.in: Adding HAVE_CUSTOM_LIBELF line.
    * configure.ac: Typo correction and addition of
      --enable-havecustomlibelf
      Version 20190520
    * scripts/buildandreleasetest.sh. Now reflects
      the new cmake option names, such as dodwarfgen=ON
      becoming DWARFGEN=ON.
2019-05-13  David Anderson
    * CmakeLists.txt: Now -Dwall=ON adds -Werror
      and reports the warning/error options.
    * configure.ac: Now version 20190513. --enable-wall
      now adds -Werror so warnings are considered errors
      by gcc.
    * configure: regenerated.
    * scripts/buildandreleasetest.sh: Now does a 
      full compile with WORDS_BIGENDIAN forced on.
      Since most testing is little-endian this forces
      a compile testing that the code
      actually builds with WORDS_BIGENDIAN 1.
2019-05-07  David Anderson
    * CMakeLists.txt: Added comment on how the find_package()
      command works. See cmake documentation.
    * cmake/FindLibElf.cmake: Added comment mentioning how
      and where this is referenced. 
2019-05-07  David Anderson
    * CMakeLists.txt: Added CXX to the project languages
      so dwarfgen will build with cmake. Version 20190507.
    * Makefile.am: Removed a file name: not needed.
    * configure: regenerated
    * configure.ac: Version 20190507
2019-05-05  David Anderson
    * Makefile.am, dwarfdump/Makefile.am, dwarfexample/Makefile.am,
      dwarfgen/Makefile.am: cmake and configure
      needed to agree on the list of files. Specifically
      configure.ac etc lists just cmake files that
      exist so it can generate a complete
      release, while CmakeLists.txt etc will not currently
      generate a complete release.  Regenerated configure.in.
2019-05-05  David Anderson
    * configure.ac,configure.cmake: Version 20190505
    * configure: regenerated
2019-05-02  David Anderson
    * scripts/buildstandardsource.sh: cmake has serious trouble
      with semicolons so now this copies the base 
      libdwarf.h.in to generated_libdwarf.in while changing
      struct Elf to struct _Elf. cmake can do a simple copy.
    * configure.cmake: Now just copies the right file with
      Elf or _Elf to libdwarf.h.
    * scripts/buildstandardsource.sh: Now creates
      generated_libdwarf.h.in from libdwarf.h.in.
      using sed. Run by developer, not library users.
    * scripts/fixlibdwarfelf.sh Now just copies the 
      right file with Elf or _Elf to libdwarf.h
      (used by configure, not cmake).
2019-05-02  David Anderson
    * Makefile.in: regenerated.
2019-05-01  David Anderson
    * CMakeLists.txt: Sets language C
    * cmake/AutoconfHelper.cmake: deleted, nothing here
      used any more.
    * cmake/FindLibElf.cmake: Now does C source test, not c++.
    * configure.cmake: moved the cmake macro includes to
      the first lines in the file.  Added a JUST_LIBELF
      variable to correctly test for off64_t
      Does checking/setting for essentially all the needed HAVE_
      etc variables.
      
2019-05-01  David Anderson
    * README.cmake: Made more complete.
    * configure.cmake: Even more setup here.
2019-05-01  David Anderson
    * CMakeLists.txt: Corrected a mistake in reporting install
      prefix.
    * cmake/AutoconfHelper.cmake: Removed unused functions,
      and for some functions changed to native cmake
      in configure.cmake.
    * configure.cmake: Now does a lot more setup here and
      using cmake (replacing some autoconf-like functions)
      And this now sets many things for each build directory,
      reducing the size of */configure.cmake files. 
2019-04-30  David Anderson
    * README.cmake: New, describes use of cmake.
    * cmake/LibdwarfMacros.cmake: Added a final newline
      charcter as such is expected.
    * configure.cmake: Added testing lines.
2019-04-26  David Anderson
    * README.cmake. New. Describes cmake use and options.
    * CMakeLists.txt,cmake/FindLibElf.cmake,configure.cmake:
      Revised to be closer to configure as to what
      it does.
2019-04-25  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190425. Updated 
      to recognize recent changes. And some
      #include/define updates for Windows.
2019-04-22  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190422. Now tests for
      stdint.h and inttypes.h. Uses AC_TYPE_UINTPTR_T
      so we can avoid a lot of warnings in 32bit and
      mingw builds.
2019-04-21  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190421. Now --enable-nonstandardprintf
      (build with some non-standard printf formats allowed)
      adds -Wno-pedantic-ms-format so gcc will not warn
      about the non-standard formats. Only affects mingw.
      Otherwise the -Wno-pedantic-ms-format option
      (which nothing but mingw has) gets dropped.
2019-04-19  David Anderson
    * NEWS: Now --disable-libelf just disables linking
      with libelf.  Elf files are read (libdwarf) and
      printf(dwarfdump). As always. The Elf reader detects
      corrupted Elf early on. 
2019-02-24  David Anderson
    * configure.ac. Version 20190223. With --disable-libelf
      most header checking is unnecessary and suppressed. 
      All the checks for int32 and the like removed 
      as we no longer use such types.
2019-02-18  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: One can build forcing a non-elf build with
      --disable-libelf . If libelf is missing or will not compile
      the disable is automatic.  Now zlib is separated so
      -lz is added to the link line with or without libelf.
      Version is 20190217
    * configure.cmake: Now always defines DWARF_WITH_LIBELF
      so cmake builds continue to work as always.
2019-02-07  David Anderson
    * configure.ac. Version 20190201. Now allows lack of
      elf.h libelf.h and if those and zlib.h missing
      then the link line shows neither -lelf nor -lz
      (libdwarf and dwarfdump will then support PE
      and mach-o objects but not elf)
2019-01-15  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190112
2019-01-10  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190110
2019-01-09  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190108
2019-01-05  David Anderson
    * configure.ac: Version 20190104
2019-01-02  David Anderson
    * ChangeLog: renamed ChangeLog2018
    * configure.ac: Version 20190102
    * Makefile.am: Now includes the tsearch files in the dist.
