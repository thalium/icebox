          Thus VirtualBox WDDM Video driver may be installed and kept in guest system

          This is caused by a bug in Guest Additions uninstaller.

          </note>
          To solve this problem, one should uninstall the VirtualBox WDDM Video driver manually.
          To do that open Device Manager, and check whether the Display Adapter is named 
          "VirtualBox Graphics Adapter ..". If no - there is nothing to be done. If yes - right-click 
          the VirtualBox Graphics Adapter in Device Manager, select "Uninstall", check "Delete the driver software for this device"
          and click "OK". Once uninstallation is done - in Device Manager go to menu "Action" and select 
          "Scan for hardware changes" to make the propper (Windows default) driver be picked up for the Graphics adapter.
