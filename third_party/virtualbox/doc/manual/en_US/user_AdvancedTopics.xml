    <title>VBoxSDL, the simplified VM displayer</title>

    <sect2>
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>VBoxSDL is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) that lacks the
      nice point-and-click support which VirtualBox, our main GUI, provides.
      VBoxSDL is currently primarily used internally for debugging VirtualBox
      and therefore not officially supported. Still, you may find it useful
      for environments where the virtual machines are not necessarily
      controlled by the same person that uses the virtual machine.<note>
          <para>VBoxSDL is not available on the Mac OS X host platform.</para>
        </note></para>

      <para>As you can see in the following screenshot, VBoxSDL does indeed
      only provide a simple window that contains only the "pure" virtual
      machine, without menus or other controls to click upon and no additional
      indicators of virtual machine activity:</para>

        </mediaobject></para>

      <para>To start a virtual machine with VBoxSDL instead of the VirtualBox
      GUI, enter the following on a command line:<screen>VBoxSDL --startvm &lt;vm&gt;</screen></para>

      <para>where <computeroutput>&lt;vm&gt;</computeroutput> is, as usual
      with VirtualBox command line parameters, the name or UUID of an existing
      virtual machine.</para>

      <title>Secure labeling with VBoxSDL</title>

      <para>When running guest operating systems in full screen mode, the guest
      operating system usually has control over the whole screen. This could
      present a security risk as the guest operating system might fool the
      user into thinking that it is either a different system (which might
      have a higher security level) or it might present messages on the screen
      that appear to stem from the host operating system.</para>

      <para>In order to protect the user against the above mentioned security
      risks, the secure labeling feature has been developed. Secure labeling
      is currently available only for VBoxSDL. When enabled, a portion of the
      display area is reserved for a label in which a user defined message is
      displayed. The label height in set to 20 pixels in VBoxSDL. The label
      font color and background color can be optionally set as hexadecimal RGB
      color values. The following syntax is used to enable secure
      labeling:</para>

      <screen>VBoxSDL --startvm "VM name"
      --securelabel --seclabelfnt ~/fonts/arial.ttf
      --seclabelsiz 14 --seclabelfgcol 00FF00 --seclabelbgcol 00FFFF</screen>

      <para>In addition to enabling secure labeling, a TrueType font has to be
      supplied. To use another font size than 12 point use the parameter
      <computeroutput>--seclabelsiz</computeroutput>.</para>

      <para>The label text can be set with <screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" "VBoxSDL/SecureLabel" "The Label"</screen>
      Changing this label will take effect immediately.</para>

      <para>Typically, full screen resolutions are limited to certain
      "standard" geometries such as 1024 x 768. Increasing this by twenty
      lines is not usually feasible, so in most cases, VBoxSDL will chose the
      next higher resolution, e.g. 1280 x 1024 and the guest's screen will not
      cover the whole display surface. If VBoxSDL is unable to choose a higher
      resolution, the secure label will be painted on top of the guest's
      screen surface. In order to address the problem of the bottom part of
      the guest screen being hidden, VBoxSDL can provide custom video modes to
      the guest that are reduced by the height of the label. For Windows
      guests and recent Solaris and Linux guests, the VirtualBox Guest
      Additions automatically provide the reduced video modes. Additionally,
      the VESA BIOS has been adjusted to duplicate its standard mode table
      with adjusted resolutions. The adjusted mode IDs can be calculated using
      the following formula:</para>

      <screen>reduced_modeid = modeid + 0x30</screen>

      <para>For example, in order to start Linux with 1024 x 748 x 16, the
      standard mode 0x117 (1024 x 768 x 16) is used as a base. The Linux video
      mode kernel parameter can then be calculated using:</para>

      <screen>vga = 0x200 | 0x117 + 0x30
vga = 839</screen>

      <para>The reason for duplicating the standard modes instead of only
      supplying the adjusted modes is that most guest operating systems
      require the standard VESA modes to be fixed and refuse to start with
      different modes.</para>

      <para>When using the X.org VESA driver, custom modelines have to be
      calculated and added to the configuration (usually in
      <literal>/etc/X11/xorg.conf</literal>. A handy tool to determine
      modeline entries can be found at <literal><ulink
      url="http://www.tkk.fi/Misc/Electronics/faq/vga2rgb/calc.html">http://www.tkk.fi/Misc/Electronics/faq/vga2rgb/calc.html</ulink></literal>.)</para>

      <title>Releasing modifiers with VBoxSDL on Linux</title>

      <para>When switching from a X virtual terminal (VT) to another VT using
      Ctrl-Alt-Fx while the VBoxSDL window has the input focus, the guest will
      receive Ctrl and Alt keypress events without receiving the corresponding
      key release events. This is an architectural limitation of Linux. In
      order to reset the modifier keys, it is possible to send
      <computeroutput>SIGUSR1</computeroutput> to the VBoxSDL main thread
      (first entry in the <computeroutput>ps</computeroutput> list). For
      example, when switching away to another VT and saving the virtual
      machine from this terminal, the following sequence can be used to make
      sure the VM is not saved with stuck modifiers:</para>

      <para><screen>kill -usr1 &lt;pid&gt;
VBoxManage controlvm "Windows 2000" savestate</screen></para>

  <sect1 id="autologon">
    <title>Automated guest logons</title>

    <para>VirtualBox provides Guest Addition modules for Windows, Linux and
    Solaris to enable automated logons on the guest.</para>

    <para>When a guest operating system is running in a virtual machine, it
    might be desirable to perform coordinated and automated logons using
    credentials from a master logon system. (With "credentials", we are
    referring to logon information consisting of user name, password and
    domain name, where each value might be empty.)</para>

    <sect2 id="autologon_win">
      <title>Automated Windows guest logons</title>

      <para>Since Windows NT, Windows has provided a modular system logon
      subsystem ("Winlogon") which can be customized and extended by means of
      so-called GINA modules (Graphical Identification and Authentication).
      With Windows Vista and Windows 7, the GINA modules were replaced with a
      new mechanism called "credential providers". The VirtualBox Guest
      Additions for Windows come with both, a GINA and a credential provider
      module, and therefore enable any Windows guest to perform automated
      logons.</para>

      <para>To activate the VirtualBox GINA or credential provider module,
      install the Guest Additions with using the command line switch
      <computeroutput>/with_autologon</computeroutput>. All the following
      manual steps required for installing these modules will be then done by
      the installer.</para>

      <para>To manually install the VirtualBox GINA module, extract the Guest
      Additions (see <xref linkend="windows-guest-file-extraction" />) and
      copy the file <computeroutput>VBoxGINA.dll</computeroutput> to the
      Windows <computeroutput>SYSTEM32</computeroutput> directory. Then, in
      the registry, create the following key: <screen>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\GinaDLL</screen>
      with a value of <computeroutput>VBoxGINA.dll</computeroutput>.</para>

      <note>
        <para>The VirtualBox GINA module is implemented as a wrapper around
        the standard Windows GINA module
        (<computeroutput>MSGINA.DLL</computeroutput>). As a result, it will
        most likely not work correctly with 3rd party GINA modules.</para>
      </note>

      <para>To manually install the VirtualBox credential provider module,
      extract the Guest Additions (see <xref
      linkend="windows-guest-file-extraction" />) and copy the file
      <computeroutput>VBoxCredProv.dll</computeroutput> to the Windows
      <computeroutput>SYSTEM32</computeroutput> directory. Then, in the
      registry, create the following keys:<screen>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\
           Authentication\Credential Providers\{275D3BCC-22BB-4948-A7F6-3A3054EBA92B}

      <para>with all default values (the key named
      <computeroutput>(Default)</computeroutput> in each key) set to
      <computeroutput>VBoxCredProv</computeroutput>. After that a new string
      named <screen>HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{275D3BCC-22BB-4948-A7F6-3A3054EBA92B}\InprocServer32\ThreadingModel</screen>
      with a value of <computeroutput>Apartment</computeroutput> has to be
      created.</para>

      <para>To set credentials, use the following command on a
      <emphasis>running</emphasis> VM:</para>

      <screen>VBoxManage controlvm "Windows XP" setcredentials "John Doe" "secretpassword" "DOMTEST"</screen>

      <para>While the VM is running, the credentials can be queried by the
      VirtualBox logon modules (GINA or credential provider) using the
      VirtualBox Guest Additions device driver. When Windows is in "logged
      out" mode, the logon modules will constantly poll for credentials and if
      they are present, a logon will be attempted. After retrieving the
      credentials, the logon modules will erase them so that the above command
      will have to be repeated for subsequent logons.</para>

      <para>For security reasons, credentials are not stored in any persistent
      manner and will be lost when the VM is reset. Also, the credentials are
      "write-only", i.e. there is no way to retrieve the credentials from the
      host side. Credentials can be reset from the host side by setting empty
      values.</para>

      <para>Depending on the particular variant of the Windows guest, the
      following restrictions apply: <orderedlist>

            Secure Attention Sequence. Also, the user name given is only
            compared to the true user name, not the user friendly name. This
            means that when you rename a user, you still have to supply the
            original user name (internally, Windows never renames user

    <sect2 id="autologon_unix">
      <title>Automated Linux/Unix guest logons</title>

      <para>Starting with version 3.2, VirtualBox provides a custom PAM module
      (Pluggable Authentication Module) which can be used to perform automated
      guest logons on platforms which support this framework. Virtually all
      modern Linux/Unix distributions rely on PAM.</para>

      <para>For automated logons on Ubuntu (or Ubuntu-derived) distributions
      using LightDM as the display manager, please see
      <xref linkend="autologon_unix_lightdm" />.</para>

      <para>The <computeroutput>pam_vbox.so</computeroutput> module itself
      <emphasis role="bold">does not</emphasis> do an actual verification of
      the credentials passed to the guest OS; instead it relies on other
      modules such as <computeroutput>pam_unix.so</computeroutput> or
      <computeroutput>pam_unix2.so</computeroutput> down in the PAM stack to
      do the actual validation using the credentials retrieved by
      <computeroutput>pam_vbox.so</computeroutput>. Therefore
      <computeroutput>pam_vbox.so</computeroutput> has to be on top of the
      authentication PAM service list.</para>

      <note>
        <para>The <computeroutput>pam_vbox.so</computeroutput> only supports
        the <computeroutput>auth</computeroutput> primitive. Other primitives

        <computeroutput>session</computeroutput> or
        <computeroutput>password</computeroutput> are not supported.</para>
      </note>

      <para>The <computeroutput>pam_vbox.so</computeroutput> module is shipped
      as part of the Guest Additions but it is not installed and/or activated
      on the guest OS by default. In order to install it, it has to be copied
      from
      <computeroutput>/opt/VBoxGuestAdditions-&lt;version&gt;/other/</computeroutput>
      to the security modules directory, usually
      <computeroutput>/lib/security/</computeroutput> on 32-bit guest Linuxes
      or <computeroutput>/lib64/security/</computeroutput> on 64-bit ones.
      Please refer to your guest OS documentation for the correct PAM module

      <para>For example, to use <computeroutput>pam_vbox.so</computeroutput>
      with a Ubuntu Linux guest OS and GDM (the GNOME Desktop Manager) to

          top. Additionally, in most Linux distributions there is a file called
          <computeroutput>/etc/pam.d/common-auth</computeroutput>. This file
          is included in many other services (like the GDM file mentioned
          above). There you also have to add the line <computeroutput>auth

        <listitem>
          <para>If authentication against the shadow database using

      <para><note>
          <para>By default, pam_vbox will not wait for credentials to arrive

          have credentials it does not wait until they arrive. Instead the
          next module in the PAM stack (depending on the PAM configuration)
          will have the chance for authentication.</para>

      <para>Starting with VirtualBox 4.1.4 pam_vbox supports various guest
      property parameters which all reside in
      <computeroutput>/VirtualBox/GuestAdd/PAM/</computeroutput>. These
      parameters allow pam_vbox to wait for credentials to be provided by the
      host and optionally can show a message while waiting for those. The
      following guest properties can be set:</para>

        <listitem>
          <para><computeroutput>CredsWait</computeroutput>: Set to "1" if

          logging in will be available. If this property is empty or get
          deleted no waiting for credentials will be performed and pam_vbox
          will act like before (see paragraph above). This property must be

        <title>VirtualBox Greeter for Ubuntu / LightDM</title>

        <para>Starting with version 4.2.12, VirtualBox comes with an own greeter

      <title>Automated Windows system preparation</title>

      <para>Beginning with Windows NT 4.0, Microsoft offers a "system
      preparation" tool (in short: Sysprep) to prepare a Windows system for
      deployment or redistribution. Whereas Windows 2000 and XP ship with
      Sysprep on the installation medium, the tool also is available for
      download on the Microsoft web site. In a standard installation of
      Windows Vista and 7, Sysprep is already included. Sysprep mainly
      consists of an executable called
      <computeroutput>sysprep.exe</computeroutput> which is invoked by the
      user to put the Windows installation into preparation mode.</para>

      <para>Starting with VirtualBox 3.2.2, the Guest Additions offer a way to
      launch a system preparation on the guest operating system in an
      automated way, controlled from the host system. To achieve that, see
      <xref linkend="guestadd-guestcontrol" /> for using the feature with the
      special identifier <computeroutput>sysprep</computeroutput> as the
      program to execute, along with the user name
      <computeroutput>sysprep</computeroutput> and password
      <computeroutput>sysprep</computeroutput> for the credentials. Sysprep
      then gets launched with the required system rights.</para>

      If for any reason you do not wish to set them all up, you can install
      the Guest Additions using the following command:</para>

      <screen>  sh ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run no_setup</screen>

      <para>After this, you will need to at least compile the kernel modules
      by running the command <screen>  rcvboxadd setup</screen>
      as root (you will need to replace <emphasis>lib</emphasis> by
      <emphasis>lib64</emphasis> on some 64bit guests), and on older guests
      without the udev service you will need to add the
      <emphasis>vboxadd</emphasis> service to the default runlevel to ensure
      that the modules get loaded.</para>

      <para>To setup the time synchronization service,
      add the service vboxadd-service to the default runlevel. To set up the
      X11 and OpenGL part of the Guest Additions, run the command
      <screen>  rcvboxadd-x11 setup</screen>
      (you do not need to enable any services for this).</para>

      <para>To recompile the guest kernel modules, use this command:
      <screen>  rcvboxadd setup</screen>
      After compilation you should reboot your guest to ensure that the new
      modules are actually used.</para>

      <para>and the correct versions for the X server are symbolically linked
      into the X.Org driver directories.</para>

      <para>For graphics integration to work correctly, the X server must load
      the vboxvideo driver (many recent X server versions look for it
      automatically if they see that they are running in VirtualBox) and for
      an optimal user experience the guest kernel drivers must be loaded and
      the Guest Additions tool VBoxClient must be running as a client in the X
      session. For mouse integration to work correctly, the guest kernel
      drivers must be loaded and in addition, in X servers from X.Org X11R6.8
      to X11R7.1 and in XFree86 version 4.3 the right vboxmouse driver must be
      loaded and associated with /dev/mouse or /dev/psaux; in X.Org server 1.3
      or later a driver for a PS/2 mouse must be loaded and the right
      vboxmouse driver must be associated with /dev/vboxguest.</para>

      <para>The VirtualBox guest graphics driver can use any graphics
      configuration for which the virtual resolution fits into the virtual
      video memory allocated to the virtual machine (minus a small amount used
      by the guest driver) as described in <xref
      linkend="settings-display" />. The driver will offer a range of standard
      modes at least up to the default guest resolution for all active guest
      monitors. In X.Org Server 1.3 and later the default mode can be changed
      by setting the output property VBOX_MODE to
      "&lt;width&gt;x&lt;height&gt;" for any guest monitor. When VBoxClient
      and the kernel drivers are active this is done automatically when the
      host requests a mode change. The driver for older versions can only
      receive new modes by querying the host for requests at regular
      intervals.</para>

      <para>With pre-1.3 X Servers you can also add your own modes to the X

    <title>CPU hot-plugging</title>

    <para>With virtual machines running modern server operating systems,
    VirtualBox supports CPU hot-plugging.<footnote>
        <para>Support for CPU hot-plugging was introduced with VirtualBox
        3.2.</para>
      </footnote> Whereas on a physical computer this would mean that a CPU
    can be added or removed while the machine is running, VirtualBox supports
    adding and removing virtual CPUs while a virtual machine is
    running.</para>

    <para>CPU hot-plugging works only with guest operating systems that
    support it. So far this applies only to Linux and Windows Server 2008 x64
    Data Center Edition. Windows supports only hot-add while Linux supports
    hot-add and hot-remove but to use this feature with more than 8 CPUs a
    64bit Linux guest is required.</para>

    <para>At this time, CPU hot-plugging requires using the VBoxManage
    command-line interface. First, hot-plugging needs to be enabled for a
    virtual machine:<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --cpuhotplug on</screen></para>

    <para>After that, the <computeroutput>--cpus</computeroutput> option specifies the maximum number of CPUs
    that the virtual machine can have:<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --cpus 8</screen>When
    the VM is off, you can then add and remove virtual CPUs with the
    <computeroutput>modifyvm --plugcpu</computeroutput> and
    <computeroutput>--unplugcpu</computeroutput> subcommands, which take the number of the
    virtual CPU as a parameter, like this:<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --plugcpu 3
VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --unplugcpu 3</screen>Note that CPU 0 can never
    be removed.</para>

    <para>While the VM is running, CPUs can be added and removed with the
    <computeroutput>controlvm plugcpu</computeroutput> and
    <computeroutput>unplugcpu</computeroutput> commands
    instead:<screen>VBoxManage controlvm "VM name" plugcpu 3
VBoxManage controlvm "VM name" unplugcpu 3</screen></para>

    <para>See <xref linkend="vboxmanage-modifyvm" /> and <xref
    linkend="vboxmanage-controlvm" /> for details.</para>

    <para>With Linux guests, the following applies: To prevent ejection while
    the CPU is still used it has to be ejected from within the guest before.
    The Linux Guest Additions contain a service which receives hot-remove
    events and ejects the CPU. Also, after a CPU is added to the VM it is not
    automatically used by Linux. The Linux Guest Additions service will take
    care of that if installed. If not a CPU can be started with the following
    command:<screen>echo 1 &gt; /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu&lt;id&gt;/online</screen></para>

    <title>PCI passthrough</title>

    <para>When running on Linux hosts, with a recent enough kernel (at least
    version <computeroutput>2.6.31</computeroutput>) experimental host PCI
    devices passthrough is available.<footnote>
        <para>Experimental support for PCI passthrough was introduced with
        VirtualBox 4.1.</para>
      </footnote></para>

    <note>
      <para>The PCI passthrough module is shipped as a VirtualBox extension
      package, which must be installed separately. See <xref
      linkend="intro-installing" /> for more information.</para>
    </note>

    <para>Essentially this feature allows to directly use physical PCI devices
    on the host by the guest even if host doesn't have drivers for this
    particular device. Both, regular PCI and some PCI Express cards, are
    supported. AGP and certain PCI Express cards are not supported at the
    moment if they rely on GART (Graphics Address Remapping Table) unit
    programming for texture management as it does rather non-trivial operations
    with pages remapping interfering with IOMMU. This limitation may be lifted
    in future releases.</para>

    <para>To be fully functional, PCI passthrough support in VirtualBox
    depends upon an IOMMU hardware unit which is not yet too widely available.
    If the device uses bus mastering (i.e. it performs DMA to the OS memory on
    its own), then an IOMMU is required, otherwise such DMA transactions may
    write to the wrong physical memory address as the device DMA engine is
    programmed using a device-specific protocol to perform memory
    transactions. The IOMMU functions as translation unit mapping physical
    memory access requests from the device using knowledge of the guest
    physical address to host physical addresses translation rules.</para>

    <para>Intel's solution for IOMMU is marketed as "Intel Virtualization
    Technology for Directed I/O" (VT-d), and AMD's one is called AMD-Vi. So
    please check if your motherboard datasheet has appropriate technology.
    Even if your hardware doesn't have a IOMMU, certain PCI cards may work
    (such as serial PCI adapters), but the guest will show a warning on boot
    and the VM execution will terminate if the guest driver will attempt to
    enable card bus mastering.</para>

    <para>It is very common that the BIOS or the host OS disables the IOMMU by
    default. So before any attempt to use it please make sure that

    <para>Once you made sure that the host kernel supports the IOMMU, the next

      <title>Using a raw host hard disk from a guest</title>

      <para>Starting with version 1.4, as an alternative to using virtual disk
      images (as described in detail in <xref linkend="storage" />),
      VirtualBox can also present either entire physical hard disks or
      selected partitions thereof as virtual disks to virtual machines.</para>

      <para>With VirtualBox, this type of access is called "raw hard disk
      access"; it allows a guest operating system to access its virtual hard
      disk without going through the host OS file system. The actual
      performance difference for image files vs. raw disk varies greatly
      depending on the overhead of the host file system, whether dynamically
      growing images are used, and on host OS caching strategies. The caching
      indirectly also affects other aspects such as failure behavior, i.e.
      whether the virtual disk contains all data written before a host OS
      crash. Consult your host OS documentation for details on this.</para>

      <para><warning>
          <para>Raw hard disk access is for expert users only. Incorrect use
          or use of an outdated configuration can lead to <emphasis
          role="bold">total loss of data </emphasis>on the physical disk. Most
          importantly, <emphasis>do not</emphasis> attempt to boot the
          partition with the currently running host operating system in a
          guest. This will lead to severe data corruption.</para>
        </warning></para>

      <para>Raw hard disk access -- both for entire disks and individual
      partitions -- is implemented as part of the VMDK image format support.
      As a result, you will need to create a special VMDK image file which
      defines where the data will be stored. After creating such a special
      VMDK image, you can use it like a regular virtual disk image. For
      example, you can use the VirtualBox Manager (<xref linkend="vdis" />)
      or <computeroutput>VBoxManage</computeroutput> to assign the image to a
      virtual machine.</para>

      <sect3>
        <title>Access to entire physical hard disk</title>

        <para>While this variant is the simplest to set up, you must be aware
        that this will give a guest operating system direct and full access to
        an <emphasis>entire physical disk</emphasis>. If your
        <emphasis>host</emphasis> operating system is also booted from this
        disk, please take special care to not access the partition from the
        guest at all. On the positive side, the physical disk can be
        repartitioned in arbitrary ways without having to recreate the image
        file that gives access to the raw disk.</para>

        <para>To create an image that represents an entire physical hard disk
        (which will not contain any actual data, as this will all be stored on
        the physical disk), on a Linux host, use the command<screen>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk
      -rawdisk /dev/sda</screen>This creates the image
        <code>/path/to/file.vmdk</code> (must be absolute), and all data will
        be read and written from <code>/dev/sda</code>.</para>

        <para>On a Windows host, instead of the above device specification,
        use e.g. <code>\\.\PhysicalDrive0</code>. On a Mac OS X host, instead
        of the above device specification use e.g. <code>/dev/disk1</code>.
        Note that on OS X you can only get access to an entire disk if no
        volume is mounted from it.</para>

        <para>Creating the image requires read/write access for the given
        device. Read/write access is also later needed when using the image
        from a virtual machine. On some host platforms (e.g. Windows Vista
        and later), raw disk access may be restricted and not permitted by
        the host OS in some situations.</para>

        <para>Just like with regular disk images, this does not automatically
        attach the newly created image to a virtual machine. This can be done
        with e.g. <screen>VBoxManage storageattach WindowsXP --storagectl "IDE Controller"
      --port 0 --device 0 --type hdd --medium /path/to/file.vmdk</screen>When
        this is done the selected virtual machine will boot from the specified
        physical disk.</para>
      </sect3>

      <sect3>
        <title>Access to individual physical hard disk partitions</title>

        <para>This "raw partition support" is quite similar to the "full hard
        disk" access described above. However, in this case, any partitioning
        information will be stored inside the VMDK image, so you can e.g.
        install a different boot loader in the virtual hard disk without
        affecting the host's partitioning information. While the guest will be
        able to <emphasis>see</emphasis> all partitions that exist on the
        physical disk, access will be filtered in that reading from partitions
        for which no access is allowed the partitions will only yield zeroes,
        and all writes to them are ignored.</para>

        <para>To create a special image for raw partition support (which will
        contain a small amount of data, as already mentioned), on a Linux
        host, use the command<screen>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk
      -rawdisk /dev/sda -partitions 1,5</screen></para>

        <para>As you can see, the command is identical to the one for "full
        hard disk" access, except for the additional
        <computeroutput>-partitions</computeroutput> parameter. This example
        would create the image <code>/path/to/file.vmdk</code> (which, again,
        must be absolute), and partitions 1 and 5 of <code>/dev/sda</code>
        would be made accessible to the guest.</para>

        <para>VirtualBox uses the same partition numbering as your Linux host.
        As a result, the numbers given in the above example would refer to the
        first primary partition and the first logical drive in the extended
        partition, respectively.</para>

        <para>On a Windows host, instead of the above device specification,
        use e.g. <code>\\.\PhysicalDrive0</code>. On a Mac OS X host, instead
        of the above device specification use e.g. <code>/dev/disk1</code>.
        Note that on OS X you can only use partitions which are not mounted
        (eject the respective volume first). Partition numbers are the same on
        Linux, Windows and Mac OS X hosts.</para>

        <para>The numbers for the list of partitions can be taken from the
        output of<screen>VBoxManage internalcommands listpartitions -rawdisk /dev/sda</screen>The
        output lists the partition types and sizes to give the user enough
        information to identify the partitions necessary for the guest.</para>

        <para>Images which give access to individual partitions are specific
        to a particular host disk setup. You cannot transfer these images to
        another host; also, whenever the host partitioning changes, the image
        <emphasis>must be recreated</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>Creating the image requires read/write access for the given
        device. Read/write access is also later needed when using the image
        from a virtual machine. If this is not feasible, there is a special
        variant for raw partition access (currently only available on Linux
        hosts) that avoids having to give the current user access to the
        entire disk. To set up such an image, use<screen>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk
      -rawdisk /dev/sda -partitions 1,5 -relative</screen>When used from a
        virtual machine, the image will then refer not to the entire disk, but
        only to the individual partitions (in the example
        <code>/dev/sda1</code> and <code>/dev/sda5</code>). As a consequence,
        read/write access is only required for the affected partitions, not
        for the entire disk. During creation however, read-only access to the
        entire disk is required to obtain the partitioning information.</para>

        <para>In some configurations it may be necessary to change the MBR
        code of the created image, e.g. to replace the Linux boot loader that
        is used on the host by another boot loader. This allows e.g. the guest
        to boot directly to Windows, while the host boots Linux from the
        "same" disk. For this purpose the
        <computeroutput>-mbr</computeroutput> parameter is provided. It
        specifies a file name from which to take the MBR code. The partition
        table is not modified at all, so a MBR file from a system with totally
        different partitioning can be used. An example of this is<screen>VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk
      -rawdisk /dev/sda -partitions 1,5 -mbr winxp.mbr</screen>The modified
        MBR will be stored inside the image, not on the host disk.</para>

        <para>The created image can be attached to a storage controller in a
        VM configuration as usual.</para>

    same configuration settings apply, except that the path name for the
    <computeroutput>Location</computeroutput> can be chosen more freely. Local
    domain sockets can be placed anywhere, provided the user running
    VirtualBox has the permission to create a new file in the directory. The

      <title>Tuning TCP/IP buffers for NAT</title>

      <para>The VirtualBox NAT stack performance is often determined by its
      interaction with the host's TCP/IP stack and the size of several buffers
      (<computeroutput>SO_RCVBUF</computeroutput> and
      <computeroutput>SO_SNDBUF</computeroutput>). For certain setups users
      might want to adjust the buffer size for a better performance. This can
      by achieved using the following commands (values are in kilobytes and
      can range from 8 to 1024): <screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --natsettings1 16000,128,128,0,0</screen>
      This example illustrates tuning the NAT settings. The first parameter is
      the MTU, then the size of the socket's send buffer and the size of the
      socket's receive buffer, the initial size of the TCP send window, and
      lastly the initial size of the TCP receive window. Note that specifying
      zero means fallback to the default value.</para>

      <title>Binding NAT sockets to a specific interface</title>

      <para>By default, VirtualBox's NAT engine will route TCP/IP packets
      through the default interface assigned by the host's TCP/IP stack. (The
      technical reason for this is that the NAT engine uses sockets for
      communication.) If, for some reason, you want to change this behavior,
      you can tell the NAT engine to bind to a particular IP address instead.
      Use the following command: <screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --natbindip1 "10.45.0.2"</screen></para>

      <para>After this, all outgoing traffic will be sent through the

      </footnote> A VirtualBox VNIC template is a VNIC whose name starts with
    "vboxvnic_template" (case-sensitive).</para>

    <para>On Solaris 11 hosts<footnote><para>When Crossbow based bridged
    networking is used.</para></footnote>, a VNIC template may be used to
    specify the VLAN ID to use while bridging over a network link.</para>

    <para>Here is an example of how to use a VNIC template to configure a VM
    over a VLAN. Create a VirtualBox VNIC template, by executing as root:</para>

    <screen>dladm create-vnic -t -l nge0 -v 23 vboxvnic_template0</screen>

    <para>This will create a temporary VNIC template over interface "nge0"
    with the VLAN ID 23. To create VNIC templates that are persistent across
    host reboots, skip the <computeroutput>-t</computeroutput> parameter in the
    above command. You may check the current state of links using:</para>

    <para><screen>$ dladm show-link
LINK        CLASS     MTU    STATE    BRIDGE     OVER
nge0        phys      1500   up       --         --
nge1        phys      1500   down     --         --
vboxvnic_template0 vnic 1500 up       --         nge0

$ dladm show-vnic
LINK         OVER         SPEED  MACADDRESS        MACADDRTYPE         VID
vboxvnic_template0 nge0   1000   2:8:20:25:12:75   random              23</screen></para>

    <para>Once the VNIC template is created, any VMs that need to be on VLAN
    23 over the interface "nge0" can be configured to bridge using this VNIC
    template.</para>

    <para>VNIC templates makes managing VMs on VLANs simpler and efficient.
    The VLAN details are not stored as part of every VM's configuration but
    rather inherited from the VNIC template while starting the VM. The VNIC
    template itself can be modified anytime using <computeroutput>dladm</computeroutput>.</para>

    <para>VNIC templates can be created with additional properties such as
    bandwidth limits, CPU fanout etc. Refer to your Solaris network
    documentation on how to accomplish this. These additional properties,
    if any, are also applied to VMs which bridge using the VNIC template.</para>

    <title>Configuring multiple host-only network interfaces on Solaris
    hosts</title>

    <para>By default VirtualBox provides you with one host-only network
    interface. Adding more host-only network interfaces on Solaris hosts
    requires manual configuration. Here's how to add another host-only
    network interface.</para>

    <para>Begin by stopping all running VMs. Then, unplumb the existing
    "vboxnet0" interface by execute the following command as root:</para>

    <screen>ifconfig vboxnet0 unplumb</screen>

    <para>If you have several vboxnet interfaces, you will need to unplumb
    all of them. Once all vboxnet interfaces are unplumbed, remove the
    driver by executing the following command as root:</para>

    <screen>rem_drv vboxnet</screen>

    <para>Edit the file <computeroutput>/platform/i86pc/kernel/drv/vboxnet.conf</computeroutput>
    and add a line for the new interface we want to add as shown below:</para>

    <screen>name="vboxnet" parent="pseudo" instance=1;
name="vboxnet" parent="pseudo" instance=2;</screen>

    <para>Add as many of these lines as required with each line having a
    unique instance number.</para>

    <para>Next, reload the vboxnet driver by executing the following command
    as root:</para>

    <screen>add_drv vboxnet</screen>

    <para>On Solaris 11.1 and newer hosts you may want to rename the default
    vanity interface name. To check what name has been assigned, execute:</para>

    <screen>dladm show-phys
LINK              MEDIA                STATE      SPEED  DUPLEX    DEVICE
net0              Ethernet             up         100    full      e1000g0
net2              Ethernet             up         1000   full      vboxnet1
net1              Ethernet             up         1000   full      vboxnet0</screen>

    <para>In the above example, we can rename "net2" to "vboxnet1" before
    proceeding to plumb the interface. This can be done by executing as root:</para>

    <screen>dladm rename-link net2 vboxnet1</screen>

    <para>Now plumb all the interfaces using
    <computeroutput>ifconfig vboxnetX plumb</computeroutput> (where 'X' would
    be 1 in this case). Once the interface is plumbed, it may be configured
    like any other network interface. Refer to the
    <computeroutput>ifconfig</computeroutput> documentation for further details.</para>

    <para>To make the newly added interfaces' settings persistent across
    reboots, you will need to edit the files
    <computeroutput>/etc/inet/netmasks</computeroutput>, and if you are using NWAM
    <computeroutput>/etc/nwam/llp</computeroutput> and add the appropriate
    entries to set the netmask and static IP for each of those interfaces. The
    VirtualBox installer only updates these configuration files for the one
    "vboxnet0" interface it creates by default.</para>

    <title>Configuring the VirtualBox CoreDumper on Solaris hosts</title>

    <para>VirtualBox is capable of producing its own core files for extensive
    debugging when things go wrong. Currently this is only available on
    Solaris hosts.</para>

    <para>The VirtualBox CoreDumper can be enabled using the following
    command:</para>

    <para><screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" VBoxInternal2/CoreDumpEnabled 1</screen></para>

    <para>You can specify which directory to use for core dumps with this
    command:</para>

    <para><screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" VBoxInternal2/CoreDumpDir &lt;path-to-directory&gt;</screen>Make
    sure the directory you specify is on a volume with sufficient free space
    and that the VirtualBox process has sufficient permissions to write files
    to this directory. If you skip this command and don't specify any core
    dump directory, the current directory of the VirtualBox executable will be
    used (which would most likely fail when writing cores as they are
    protected with root permissions). It is recommended you explicitly set a
    core dump directory.</para>

    <para>You must specify when the VirtualBox CoreDumper should be triggered.
    This is done using the following commands:</para>

    <para><screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" VBoxInternal2/CoreDumpReplaceSystemDump 1
VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" VBoxInternal2/CoreDumpLive 1</screen>At
    least one of the above two commands will have to be provided if you have
    enabled the VirtualBox CoreDumper.</para>

    <para>Setting <computeroutput>CoreDumpReplaceSystemDump</computeroutput>
    sets up the VM to override the host's core dumping mechanism and in the
    event of any crash only the VirtualBox CoreDumper would produce the core
    file.</para>

    <para>Setting <computeroutput>CoreDumpLive</computeroutput> sets up the VM
    to produce cores whenever the VM process receives a
    <computeroutput>SIGUSR2</computeroutput> signal. After producing the core
    file, the VM will not be terminated and will continue to run. You can thus
    take cores of the VM process using:</para>

    <para><screen>kill -s SIGUSR2 &lt;VM-process-id&gt;</screen></para>

    <para>Core files produced by the VirtualBox CoreDumper are of the form
    <computeroutput>core.vb.&lt;ProcessName&gt;.&lt;ProcessID&gt;</computeroutput>,
    for example <computeroutput>core.vb.VBoxHeadless.11321</computeroutput>.</para>

    <title>VirtualBox and Solaris kernel zones</title>

    <para>Solaris kernel zones on x86-based systems make use of hardware-assisted
    virtualization features like VirtualBox does. However, for kernel zones and
    VirtualBox to share this hardware resource, they need to co-operate.</para>

    <para>By default, due to performance reasons, VirtualBox acquires the
    hardware-assisted virtualization resource (VT-x/AMD-V) globally on the
    host machine and uses it until the last VirtualBox VM that requires it is
    powered off. This prevents other software from using VT-x/AMD-V during the
    time VirtualBox has taken control of it.</para>

    <para>VirtualBox can be instructed to relinquish use of hardware-assisted
    virtualization features when not executing guest code, thereby allowing
    kernel zones to make use of them. To do this, shutdown all VirtualBox VMs
    and execute the following command:</para>

    <screen>VBoxManage setproperty hwvirtexclusive off</screen>

    <para>This command needs to be executed only once as the setting is stored
    as part of the global VirtualBox settings which will continue to persist
    across host-reboots and VirtualBox upgrades.</para>

    <para>Starting with VirtualBox 4.2.0 there is another extension pack,
    <code>VNC</code>, which is open source and replaces the previous
    integration of the VNC remote access protocol. This is experimental code,
    and will be initially available in the VirtualBox source code package only.
    It is to a large portion code contributed by users, and is not supported
    in any way by Oracle.</para>

    <para>The keyboard handling is severely limited, and only the US keyboard
    layout works. Other keyboard layouts will have at least some keys which
    produce the wrong results (often quite surprising effects), and for layouts
    which have significant differences to the US keyboard layout it is most
    likely unusable.</para>

    <para>It is possible to install both the Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension
    Pack and VNC, but only one VRDE module can be active at any time. The
    following command switches to the VNC VRDE module in
    VNC:<screen>VBoxManage setproperty vrdeextpack VNC</screen></para>

    <para>Configuring the remote access works very similarly to VRDP (see
    <xref linkend="vrde" />), with some limitations: VNC does not
    support specifying several port numbers, and the authentication is done
    differently. VNC can only deal with password authentication, and there
    is no option to use password hashes. This leaves no other choice than
    having a clear-text password in the VM configuration, which can be set with
    the following command:<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --vrdeproperty VNCPassword=secret</screen></para>

    <para>The user is responsible for keeping this password secret, and it
    should be removed when a VM configuration is passed to another person,
    for whatever purpose. Some VNC servers claim to have "encrypted" passwords
    in the configuration. This is not true encryption, it is only concealing
    the passwords, which is exactly as secure as clear-text passwords.</para>

      The first one is <computeroutput>VBOXAUTOSTART_DB</computeroutput> which

      The directory should have write access for every user who should be able to
      start virtual machines automatically. Furthermore the directory should have the

      The second variable is <computeroutput>VBOXAUTOSTART_CONFIG</computeroutput>
      which points the service to the autostart configuration file which is used
      during boot to determine whether to allow individual users to start a VM
      automatically and configure startup delays.
      The configuration file can be placed in <computeroutput>/etc/vbox</computeroutput>
      and contains several options. One is <computeroutput>default_policy</computeroutput>
      which controls whether the autostart service allows or denies to start a VM
      for users which are not in the exception list.
      The exception list starts with <computeroutput>exception_list</computeroutput>
      and contains a comma separated list with usernames. Furthermore a separate
      startup delay can be configured for every user to avoid overloading the host.
      A sample configuration is given below:</para>

  <sect1 id="heartbeatservice">
    <title>Configuring the heartbeat service</title>
    <para>
      VirtualBox ships a simple heartbeat service. Once the Guest Additions are

      stops sending the heartbeat pings without properly terminating the service,
      the VM process will log this event in the VBox.log file. In the future it
      might be possible to configure dedicated actions but for now there is only a
      warning in the log file.</para>

    <para>
      There are two parameters to configure. The <emphasis>heartbeat interval</emphasis>
      defines the time between two heartbeat pings. The default value is 2 seconds, that
      is, the heartbeat service of the VirtualBox Guest Additions will send a heartbeat
      ping every two seconds. The value in nanoseconds can be configured like this:
    </para>
    <screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" VBoxInternal/Devices/VMMDev/0/Config/HeartbeatInterval 2000000000</screen>
    <para>
      The <emphasis>heartbeat timeout</emphasis> defines the time the host waits
      starting from the last heartbeat ping before it defines the guest as unresponsive.
      The default value is 2 times the heartbeat interval (4 seconds) and can be configured
      as following (in nanoseconds):

  <sect1 id="diskencryption">
    <title>Encryption of disk images</title>

    <para>
      Starting with VirtualBox 5.0, it is possible to encrypt the data stored in
      hard disk images transparently for the guest. It does not depend on a specific
      image format to be used. Images which have the data encrypted are not portable
      between VirtualBox and other virtualization software.
    </para>

    <para>
      VirtualBox uses the AES algorithm in XTS mode and supports 128 or 256 bit
      data encryption keys (DEK).
      The DEK is stored encrypted in the medium properties and is decrypted during
      VM startup by entering a password which was chosen when the image was encrypted.
    </para>

    <para>
      Since the DEK is stored as part of the VM configuration file, it is
      important that it is kept safe. Losing the DEK means that the data stored
      in the disk images is lost irrecoverably. Having complete and up to
      date backups of all data related to the VM is the responsibility of the
      user.

      <para>
        Encrypting disk images can be done either using the GUI or VBoxManage.
        While the GUI is easier to use, it works on a per VM basis and encrypts
        all disk images attached to the specific VM.
        With VBoxManage one can encrypt individual images (including all differencing
        images). To encrypt an unencrypted medium with VBoxManage, use:
      </para>

      <screen>VBoxManage encryptmedium "uuid|filename" --newpassword "file|-" --cipher "cipher id" --newpasswordid "id"</screen>

      <para>
        To supply the encryption password point VBoxManage to the file where the
        password is stored or specify <computeroutput>-</computeroutput> to let VBoxManage
        ask you for the password on the command line.
      </para>
      <para>
        The cipher parameter specifies the cipher to use for encryption and can be either
        <computeroutput>AES-XTS128-PLAIN64</computeroutput> or <computeroutput>AES-XTS256-PLAIN64</computeroutput>.
        The specified password identifier can be freely chosen by the user and is
        used for correct identification when supplying multiple passwords during
        VM startup.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the user uses the same password when encrypting multiple images and also the
        same password identifier, the user needs to supply the password only once during
        VM startup.

        If another frontend like VBoxHeadless is used, the VM will be paused as soon
        as the guest tries to access an encrypted disk.
        The user needs to provide the passwords through VBoxManage using the following
        command:
      </para>

      <screen>VBoxManage controlvm "uuid|vmname" addencpassword "id" "password" [--removeonsuspend "yes|no"]</screen>

      <para>

        used when encrypting the images. The user can optionally specify
        <computeroutput>--removeonsuspend "yes|no"</computeroutput> to specify whether
        to remove the password from VM memory when the VM is suspended. Before the VM can be
        resumed, the user needs to supply the passwords again. This is useful when

    <title>PC speaker passthrough</title>

    <para>As an experimental feature (primarily due to being limited to Linux
    host only and unknown Linux distribution coverage) VirtualBox supports
    passing through the PC speaker to the host. The PC speaker (sometimes
    called system speaker) is a way to produce audible feedback such as beeps
    without the need for regular audio/sound card support.</para>

    <para>The PC speaker passthrough feature in VirtualBox handles beeps only.
    Advanced PC speaker use by the VM (such as PCM audio) will not work,
    resulting in undefined host behavior.</para>

    <para>Producing beeps on Linux is unfortunately a very complex topic.
    VirtualBox offers a collection of options, in an attempt to make this work
    deterministically and reliably on as many Linux distributions and system
    configurations as possible:

      </table>
    </para>

    <para>To enable PC speaker passthrough use the following command:
      <screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" "VBoxInternal/Devices/i8254/0/Config/PassthroughSpeaker" N</screen>
    Replace <computeroutput>N</computeroutput> with the code representing the
    case you want to use. Changing this setting will take effect when the VM is
    started next. It is safe to enable PC speaker passthrough on all host OSes.
    It will only have an effect on Linux.</para>

    <para>The VM log file, <computeroutput>VBox.log</computeroutput>, will
    contain lines with the prefix <computeroutput>PIT: speaker:</computeroutput>
    showing the PC speaker passthrough setup activities. It gives hints which
    device it picked or why it failed.</para>

    <para>Enabling PC speaker passthrough for the VM is usually the simple
    part. The real difficulty is making sure that VirtualBox can access the
    necessary device, because in a typical Linux install most of them can only
    be accessed by user <computeroutput>root</computeroutput>. You should
    follow the preferred way to persistently change this, e.g. by referring to
    your distribution's documentation. Since there are countless Linux
    distribution variants, we can only give the general hints that there is
    often a way to give the X11 session user access to additional devices, or
    you need to find a working solution using a udev configuration file. If
    everything fails you might try setting the permissions using a script
    which is run late enough in the host system startup.</para>

    <para>Sometimes additional rules are applied by the kernel to limit access
    (e.g. that the VM process must have the same controlling terminal as the
    device configured to be used for beeping, something which is often very
    difficult to achieve for GUI applications such as VirtualBox). The table
    above contains some hints, but generally refer to the Linux
    documentation.</para>

    <para>If you have trouble getting any beeps even if the device permissions
    are set up and VBox.log confirms that it uses evdev or console for the
    PC speaker control, check if your system has a PC speaker. Some systems do
    not have one. Other complications can arise from Linux rerouting the PC
    speaker output to a sound card. Check if the beeps are audible if you
    connect speakers to your sound card. Today almost all systems have one.
    Finally, check if the audio mixer control has a channel named "beep"
    (could be hidden in the mixer settings) and that it isn't muted.</para>

  <sect1 id="usbip">
    <title>Accessing USB devices exposed over the network with USB/IP</title>

    <para>Starting with 5.1.0, VirtualBox supports passing through USB
    devices which are exposed over the network using the USB over IP protocol
    without the need to configure the client side provided by the kernel and
    usbip tools. Furthermore, this feature works with VirtualBox running on any
    supported host, rather than just Linux alone - as is the case with the official
    client.</para>

    <para>To enable support for passing through USB/IP devices, the device server exporting
    the devices must be added with the following command:
    <screen>VBoxManage usbdevsource add "Unique name" --backend "USBIP" --address "Device server[:port]"</screen>
    USB devices exported on the device server are then accessible through the GUI
    or VBoxManage, like any USB devices attached locally. This can be used multiple times
    to access different device servers.</para>

    <para>To remove a device server, the following command can be used:
      <screen>VBoxManage usbdevsource remove "Unique name"</screen>
    </para>

    <sect2 id="usbip-setup-server">
      <title>Setting up USB/IP support on a Linux system</title>

      <para>This section gives a brief overview on how to set up a Linux based system
      to act as a USB device server. The system on the server requires that the
      <computeroutput>usbip-core.ko</computeroutput> and
      <computeroutput>usbip-host.ko</computeroutput> kernel drivers
      are available, and that the USB/IP tools package is installed.
      The particular installation method for the necessary tools depends on which
      distribution is used.
      For example, for Debian based systems - the following command should be used to
      install the required tools:
      <screen>apt-get install usbip-utils</screen></para>
      <para>To check whether the necessary tools are already installed use
      the following command:
      <screen>
$ usbip list -l
      </screen></para>
      <para>
      which should produce output similar to that shown in the example below:
      <screen>
 - busid 4-2 (0bda:0301)
   Realtek Semiconductor Corp. : multicard reader (0bda:0301)

 - busid 5-1 (046d:c52b)
   Logitech, Inc. : Unifying Receiver (046d:c52b)
      </screen></para>

      <para>If everything is installed, the USB/IP server needs to be started as
      <computeroutput>root</computeroutput> using the following command:
      <screen>usbipd -D</screen>
      Refer to the documentation for the installed distribution to determine how to start the
      service when the system boots.</para>

      <para>By default, no device on the server is exported - and this must be done manually
      for each device. To export a device use:
      <screen>usbip bind -b "bus identifier"</screen>
      To export the multicard reader from above, for example  - use:
      <screen>usbip bind -b 4-2</screen></para>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 id="usbip-security">
      <title>Security considerations</title>

      <para>The communication between the server and client is unencrypted and
      there is no authorization required to access exported devices. An attacker
      might sniff sensitive data or gain control over a device. To mitigate this
      risk, the device should be exposed over a local network to which only trusted
      clients have access. To access the device remotely over a public network,
      a VPN solution should be used to provide the required level of security protection.</para>
