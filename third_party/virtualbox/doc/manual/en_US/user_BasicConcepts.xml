  <title>Configuring virtual machines</title>

  <para>Whereas <xref linkend="Introduction" /> gave you a quick introduction
  to VirtualBox and how to get your first virtual machine running, the
  following chapter describes in detail how to configure virtual
  machines.</para>

  <para>You have considerable latitude in deciding what virtual hardware will
  be provided to the guest. The virtual hardware can be used for communicating
  with the host system or with other guests. For instance, if you provide
  VirtualBox with the image of a CD-ROM in an ISO file, VirtualBox can present
  this image to a guest system as if it were a physical CD-ROM. Similarly, you
  can give a guest system access to the real network via its virtual network
  card, and, if you so choose, give the host system, other guests, or
  computers on the Internet access to the guest system.</para>

    <title>Supported guest operating systems</title>

    <para>Since VirtualBox is designed to provide a generic virtualization
    environment for x86 systems, it may run operating systems of any kind,
    even those not listed here. However, the focus is to optimize VirtualBox
    for the following guest systems:</para>

      <title>Mac OS X guests</title>

      <para>Starting with version 3.2, VirtualBox has experimental support for
      Mac OS X guests. This allows you to install and execute unmodified
      versions of Mac OS X on supported host hardware.</para>

      <para>Whereas competing solutions perform modifications to the Mac OS X
      install DVDs (e.g. different boot loader and replaced files), VirtualBox
      is the first product to provide the modern PC architecture expected by
      OS X without requiring any "hacks".</para>

      <para>You should be aware of a number of <emphasis role="bold">important
      issues</emphasis> before attempting to install a Mac OS X guest:<orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Mac OS X is commercial, licensed software and contains
            <emphasis role="bold">both license and technical restrictions</emphasis>
            that limit its use to certain hardware and usage scenarios. It is
            important that you understand and obey these restrictions.</para>

            <para>In particular, for most versions of Mac OS X, Apple prohibits
            installing them on non-Apple hardware.</para>

            <para>These license restrictions are also enforced on a technical
            level. Mac OS X verifies whether it is running on Apple hardware,
            and most DVDs that come with Apple hardware even check for an
            exact model. These restrictions are <emphasis>not</emphasis>
            circumvented by VirtualBox and continue to apply.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Only <emphasis role="bold">CPUs</emphasis> known and tested
            by Apple are supported. As a result, if your Intel CPU is newer
            than the build of Mac OS X, or if you have a non-Intel CPU, it will
            most likely panic during bootup with an "Unsupported CPU"
            exception. It is generally best to use the Mac OS X DVD that came
            with your Apple hardware.</para>

    <title>Unattended guest installation</title>
    <para>VirtualBox is able to automatically install a guest by providing
    the installation medium as well as a few parameters like the name of
    the default user.</para>
    <para>To perform an unattended guest installation, a VM has to be
    prepared. A VM can be created using the GUI as described in <xref
    linkend="gui-createvm" /> or by using VBoxManage as described in
    <xref linkend="vboxmanage-createvm" />. In general it's sufficient to
    chose the type of the guest operating system and to use the proposed
    defaults for that operating system. See the following sections on how
    to change the VM settings for certain needs.</para>
    <para>After the VM was created, the VM has to be prepared for unattended
    guest execution use VBoxManage, see <xref
    linkend="vboxmanage-unattended" />. During this step VirtualBox scans
    the installation medium and changes certain parameters for a seamless
    installation as a guest running on VirtualBox.</para>
    <para>Once the preparation phase was successfully finished, the VM can
    be started either from the GUI or from VBoxManage, see <xref
    linkend="vboxmanage-startvm" />. The VM will now perform the automatic
    installation. Please note that the boot order was changed during the
    preparation phase by giving the virtual hard disk the highest priority.
    As the disk is normally empty before an automatic installation is started,
    the VM will boot from the virtual DVD drive as next available boot medium
    and the installation will start. If, for some reason, the virtual hard
    disk contains a bootable operating system then the installation will not
    start unless the boot order was manually changed by pressing F12 during
    the BIOS splash screen.</para>

    <title>Emulated hardware</title>

    <para>VirtualBox virtualizes nearly all hardware of the host. Depending on
    a VM's configuration, the guest will see the following virtual
    hardware:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Input devices.</emphasis> By default,
          VirtualBox emulates a standard PS/2 keyboard and mouse. These
          devices are supported by almost all past and present operating
          systems.</para>

          <para>In addition, VirtualBox can provide virtual USB input devices
          to avoid having to capture mouse and keyboard, as described in <xref
          linkend="keyb_mouse_normal" />.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Graphics.</emphasis> The VirtualBox
          graphics device (sometimes referred to as VGA device) is, unlike
          nearly all other emulated devices, not based on any physical
          counterpart. It is a simple, synthetic device which provides
          compatibility with standard VGA and several extended registers used
          by the VESA BIOS Extensions (VBE).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Storage.</emphasis> VirtualBox currently
          emulates the standard ATA interface found on Intel PIIX3/PIIX4
          chips, the SATA (AHCI) interface, and two SCSI adapters (LSI Logic
          and BusLogic); see <xref linkend="harddiskcontrollers" /> for
          details. Whereas providing one of these would be enough for
          VirtualBox by itself, this multitude of storage adapters is required
          for compatibility with other hypervisors. Windows is particularly
          picky about its boot devices, and migrating VMs between hypervisors
          is very difficult or impossible if the storage controllers are
          different.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="bold">USB.</emphasis> VirtualBox emulates three
          USB host controllers: xHCI, EHCI, and OHCI. While xHCI handles all USB
          transfer speeds, only guest operating systems released approximately
          after 2011 support xHCI. Note that for Windows 7 guests, 3rd party
          drivers must be installed for xHCI support.</para>
          <para>
          Older operating systems typically support OHCI and EHCI. The two
          controllers are needed because OHCI only handles USB low- and full-speed
          devices (both USB 1.x and 2.0), while EHCI only handles high-speed
          devices (USB 2.0 only).</para>
          <para>
          The emulated USB controllers do not
          communicate directly with devices on the host but rather with a
          virtual USB layer which abstracts the USB protocol and allows the

              <para>This sets the amount of RAM that is allocated and given to
              the VM when it is running. The specified amount of memory will
              be requested from the host operating system, so it must be
              available or made available as free memory on the host when
              attempting to start the VM and will not be available to the host

              <para>Here you can select which chipset will be presented to the

              as Mac OS X, that old chipset is no longer well supported. As a
              result, VirtualBox 4.0 introduced an emulation of the more
              modern ICH9 chipset, which supports PCI express, three PCI
              buses, PCI-to-PCI bridges and Message Signaled Interrupts
              (MSI). This allows modern operating systems to address more PCI
              devices and no longer requires IRQ sharing. Using the ICH9 chipset
              it is also possible to configure up to 36 network cards (up to 8
              network adapters with PIIX3). Note that the ICH9 support is

              VirtualBox reports to the virtual machine that a USB tablet
              device is present and communicates mouse events to
              the virtual machine through this device. The third setting is
              a <emphasis>USB Multi-Touch Tablet</emphasis> which is suited

              <para>Using the virtual USB tablet has the advantage that
              movements are reported in absolute coordinates (instead of as

              <para>Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controllers (APICs) are a
              newer x86 hardware feature that have replaced old-style
              Programmable Interrupt Controllers (PICs) in recent years. With
              an I/O APIC, operating systems can use more than 16 interrupt
              requests (IRQs) and therefore avoid IRQ sharing for improved
              reliability.<note>
                  <para>Enabling the I/O APIC is <emphasis>required</emphasis>
                  for 64-bit guest operating systems, especially Windows
                  Vista; it is also required if you want to use more than one
                  virtual CPU in a virtual machine.</para>
                </note></para>

              <para>However, software support for I/O APICs has been
              unreliable with some operating systems other than Windows. Also,
              the use of an I/O APIC slightly increases the overhead of

      <para>On the "Processor" tab, you can set how many virtual <emphasis

      Starting with version 3.0, VirtualBox supports symmetrical
      multiprocessing (SMP) and can present up to 32 virtual CPU cores to each
      virtual machine.</para>

      <para>You should not, however, configure virtual machines to use more
      CPU cores than you have available physically (real cores, no hyperthreads).</para>

      <para>On this tab you can also set the <emphasis role="bold">"CPU execution
      cap"</emphasis>. This setting
      limits the amount of time a host CPU spends to emulate a virtual CPU.
      The default setting is 100% meaning that there is no limitation. A setting
      of 50% implies a single virtual CPU can use up to 50% of a single host
      CPU. Note that limiting the execution time of the virtual CPUs may induce
      guest timing problems.</para>

      <para>In addition, the <emphasis role="bold">"Enable PAE/NX"</emphasis>
      setting determines whether the PAE and NX capabilities of the host CPU
      will be exposed to the virtual machine. PAE stands for "Physical Address
      Extension". Normally, if enabled and supported by the operating system,
      then even a 32-bit x86 CPU can access more than 4 GB of RAM. This is
      made possible by adding another 4 bits to memory addresses, so that with
      36 bits, up to 64 GB can be addressed. Some operating systems (such as
      Ubuntu Server) require PAE support from the CPU and cannot be run in a
      virtual machine without it.</para>

      This is the case with most CPUs built after 2006.</para>

      <para>You can select for each virtual machine individually whether
      VirtualBox should use software or hardware virtualization.<footnote>
          <para>Prior to VirtualBox version 2.2, software virtualization was
          the default; starting with version 2.2, VirtualBox will enable
          hardware virtualization by default for new virtual machines that you
          create. (Existing virtual machines are not automatically changed for
          compatibility reasons, and the default can of course be changed for
          each virtual machine.)</para>
        </footnote></para>

      <para>In most cases, the default settings will be fine; VirtualBox will
      have picked sensible defaults depending on the operating system that you

    <para>The "Storage" category in the VM settings allows you to connect

    machine.</para>

    <para>In a real PC, so-called "storage controllers" connect physical disk
    drives to the rest of the computer. Similarly, VirtualBox presents virtual
    storage controllers to a virtual machine. Under each controller, the
    virtual devices (hard disks, CD/DVD or floppy drives) attached to the
    controller are shown.<note>
        <para>This section can only give you a quick introduction to the
        VirtualBox storage settings. Since VirtualBox gives you an enormous
        wealth of options in this area, we have dedicated an entire chapter of
        this User Manual to explaining all the details: please see <xref
        linkend="storage" />.</para>
      </note></para>

    <para>If you have used the "Create VM" wizard to create a machine, you
    will normally see something like the following:</para>

    <para><mediaobject>
        <imageobject>
          <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/vm-settings-harddisk.png"
                     width="10cm" />
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject></para>

    <para>Depending on the guest operating system type that you selected when
    you created the VM, the typical layout of storage devices in a new VM is
    as follows:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>You will see an <emphasis role="bold">IDE
          controller,</emphasis> to which a virtual CD/DVD drive has been
          attached (to the "secondary master" port of the IDE
          controller).</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>You will also see a <emphasis role="bold">SATA
          controller,</emphasis> which is a more modern type of storage
          controller for higher hard disk data throughput, to which the
          virtual hard disks are attached. Initially you will normally have
          one such virtual disk, but as you can see in the above screenshot,
          you can have more than one, each represented by a disk image file
          (VDI files, in this case).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>

    <para>If you created your VM with an older version of VirtualBox, the
    default storage layout may differ. You might then only have an IDE
    controller to which both the CD/DVD drive and the hard disks have been
    attached. This might also apply if you selected an older operating system
    type when you created the VM. Since older operating systems do not support
    SATA without additional drivers, VirtualBox will make sure that no such
    devices are present initially. Please see <xref
    linkend="harddiskcontrollers" /> for additional information.</para>

    <para>VirtualBox also provides a <emphasis role="bold">floppy
    controller</emphasis>, which is special: you cannot add devices other than
    floppy drives to it. Virtual floppy drives, like virtual CD/DVD drives,
    can be connected to either a host floppy drive (if you have one) or a disk
    image, which in this case must be in RAW format.</para>

    <para>You can modify these media attachments freely. For example, if you
    wish to copy some files from another virtual disk that you created, you
    can connect that disk as a second hard disk, as in the above screenshot.
    You could also add a second virtual CD/DVD drive, or change where these
    items are attached. The following options are available:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>To <emphasis role="bold">add another virtual hard disk, or a

    <para>The "Network" section in a virtual machine's Settings window allows

    and how they operate.</para>

    <para>When you first create a virtual machine, VirtualBox by default
    enables one virtual network card and selects the "Network Address
    Translation" (NAT) mode for it. This way the guest can connect to the
    outside world using the host's networking and the outside world can
    connect to services on the guest which you choose to make visible outside
    of the virtual machine.</para>

    <para>This default setup is good for probably 95% of VirtualBox users.
    However, VirtualBox is extremely flexible in how it can virtualize
    networking. It supports many virtual network cards per virtual machine,
    the first four of which can be configured in detail in the Manager window.
    Additional network cards can be configured on the command line with
    VBoxManage. </para>

  <sect1 id="serialports">
    <title>Serial ports</title>

    <para>VirtualBox fully supports virtual serial ports in a virtual machine
    in an easy-to-use manner.<footnote>
        <para>Serial port support was added with VirtualBox 1.5.</para>
      </footnote></para>

    <para>Ever since the original IBM PC, personal computers have been
    equipped with one or two serial ports (also called COM ports by DOS and
    Windows). Serial ports were commonly used with modems, and some
    computer mice used to be connected to serial ports before USB became
    commonplace.
    </para>

    <para>While serial ports are no longer as ubiquitous as they used to be,
    there are still some important uses left for them. For example, serial
    ports can be used to set up a primitive network over a null-modem cable,
    in case Ethernet is not available. Also, serial ports are indispensable
    for system programmers needing to do kernel debugging, since kernel
    debugging software usually interacts with developers over a serial port.
    With virtual serial ports, system programmers can do kernel debugging on a
    virtual machine instead of needing a real computer to connect to.</para>

    <para>If a virtual serial port is enabled, the guest operating system sees
    a standard 16550A compatible UART device. Both receiving and transmitting
    data is supported. How this virtual serial port is then connected to the
    host is configurable, and the details depend on your host operating system.
    </para>

    <para>You can use either the graphical user interface or the command-line
    <computeroutput>VBoxManage</computeroutput> tool to set up virtual serial
    ports. For the latter, please refer to <xref
    linkend="vboxmanage-modifyvm" />; in that section, look for the
    <computeroutput>--uart</computeroutput> and
    <computeroutput>--uartmode</computeroutput> options.</para>

    <para>In either case, you can configure up to four virtual serial ports per
    virtual machine. For each such device, you will need to

      <para>The "USB" section in a virtual machine's Settings window allows
      you to configure VirtualBox's sophisticated USB support.</para>

      <para>VirtualBox can allow virtual machines to access the USB devices on
      your host directly. To achieve this, VirtualBox presents the guest
      operating system with a virtual USB controller. As soon as the guest
      system starts using a USB device, it will appear as unavailable on the
      host.<note>
          <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Be careful with USB devices that are currently in use on
              the host! For example, if you allow your guest to connect to
              your USB hard disk that is currently mounted on the host, when
              the guest is activated, it will be disconnected from the host
              without a proper shutdown. This may cause data loss.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>

          </orderedlist>
        </note></para>

      <para>In addition to allowing a guest access to your local USB devices,
      VirtualBox even allows your guests to connect to remote USB devices by
      use of the VirtualBox Remote Desktop Extension (VRDE). For details about
      this, see <xref linkend="usb-over-rdp" />.</para>

      <para>In the Settings dialog, you can first configure whether USB is
      available in the guest at all, and then choose the level of USB support:
      OHCI for USB 1.1, EHCI (which will also enable OHCI) for USB 2.0,
      or xHCI for all USB speeds. <note>
          <para>The xHCI and EHCI controllers are shipped as a VirtualBox extension
          package, which must be installed separately. See <xref
          linkend="intro-installing" /> for more information.</para>
        </note></para>

      <para>When USB support is enabled for a VM, you can determine in detail
      which devices will be automatically attached to the guest. For this, you
      can create so-called "filters" by specifying certain properties of
      the USB device. USB devices with a matching filter will be automatically
      passed to the guest once they are attached to the host. USB devices
      without a matching filter can be passed manually to the guest, for
      example by using the Devices / USB devices menu.</para>

      <para>Clicking on the "+" button to the right of the "USB Device
      Filters" window creates a <emphasis role="bold">new filter.</emphasis>
      You can give the filter a name (for referencing it later) and specify
      the filter criteria. The more criteria you specify, the more precisely
      devices will be selected. For instance, if you specify only a vendor ID
      of 046d, all devices produced by Logitech will be available to the
      guest. If you fill in all fields, on the other hand, the filter will
      only apply to a particular device model from a particular vendor, and
      not even to other devices of the same type with a different revision and
      serial number.</para>

      <para>In detail, the following criteria are available:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Vendor and product ID.</emphasis> With
          USB, each vendor of USB products carries an identification number
          that is unique world-wide, the "vendor ID". Similarly, each line of
          products is assigned a "product ID" number. Both numbers are
          commonly written in hexadecimal (that is, they are composed of the
          numbers 0-9 and the letters A-F), and a colon separates the vendor
          from the product ID. For example,
          <computeroutput>046d:c016</computeroutput> stands for Logitech as a
          vendor, and the "M-UV69a Optical Wheel Mouse" product.</para>

          <para>Alternatively, you can also specify <emphasis
          role="bold">"Manufacturer"</emphasis> and <emphasis
          role="bold">"Product"</emphasis> by name.</para>

          <para>To list all the USB devices that are connected to your host
          machine with their respective vendor and product IDs, you can use
          the following command (see <xref linkend="vboxmanage" />): <screen>VBoxManage list usbhost</screen></para>

          <para>On Windows, you can also see all USB devices that are attached
          to your system in the Device Manager. On Linux, you can use the
          <computeroutput>lsusb</computeroutput> command.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Serial number.</emphasis> While vendor
          and product ID are already quite specific to identify USB devices,
          if you have two identical devices of the same brand and product
          line, you will also need their serial numbers to filter them out
          correctly.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis role="bold">Remote.</emphasis> This setting
          specifies whether the device will be local only, or remote only
          (over VRDP), or either.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>On a Windows host, you will need to unplug and reconnect a USB
      device to use it after creating a filter for it.</para>

      <para>As an example, you could create a new USB filter and specify a
      vendor ID of 046d (Logitech, Inc), a manufacturer index of 1, and "not
      remote". Then any USB devices on the host system produced by Logitech,
      Inc with a manufacturer index of 1 will be visible to the guest
      system.</para>

      <para>Several filters can select a single device -- for example, a
      filter which selects all Logitech devices, and one which selects a
      particular webcam.</para>

      <para>You can <emphasis role="bold">deactivate</emphasis> filters
      without deleting them by clicking in the checkbox next to the filter
      name.</para>

      <title>Implementation notes for Windows and Linux hosts</title>

      <para>On Windows hosts, a kernel mode device driver provides USB proxy
      support. It implements both a USB monitor, which allows VirtualBox to
      capture devices when they are plugged in, and a USB device driver to
      claim USB devices for a particular virtual machine. As opposed to
      VirtualBox versions before 1.4.0, system reboots are no longer necessary
      after installing the driver. Also, you no longer need to replug devices
      for VirtualBox to claim them.</para>

      <para>On newer Linux hosts, VirtualBox accesses USB devices through
      special files in the file system. When VirtualBox is installed, these
      are made available to all users in the
      <computeroutput>vboxusers</computeroutput> system group. In order to be
      able to access USB from guest systems, make sure that you are a member
      of this group.</para>

      <para>On older Linux hosts, USB devices are accessed using the
      <computeroutput>usbfs</computeroutput> file system. Therefore, the user
      executing VirtualBox needs read and write permission to the USB file
      system. Most distributions provide a group (e.g.
      <computeroutput>usbusers</computeroutput>) which the VirtualBox user
      needs to be added to. Also, VirtualBox can only proxy to virtual
      machines USB devices which are not claimed by a Linux host USB driver.
      The <computeroutput>Driver=</computeroutput> entry in
      <computeroutput>/proc/bus/usb/devices</computeroutput> will show you
      which devices are currently claimed. Please refer to <xref
      linkend="ts_usb-linux" /> also for details about
      <computeroutput>usbfs</computeroutput>.</para>

    <para>Shared folders allow you to easily exchange data between a virtual

          <para>In full screen or seamless mode, VirtualBox can display a
          small toolbar that contains some of the items that are normally
          available from the virtual machine's menu bar. This toolbar
          reduces itself to a small gray line unless you move the mouse
          over it. With the toolbar, you can return from full screen or
          seamless mode, control machine execution or enable certain
          devices. If you don't want to see the toolbar, disable this
          setting.</para>

  <sect1 id="efi">
    <title>Alternative firmware (EFI)</title>

    <para>Starting with release 3.1, VirtualBox includes experimental support
    for the Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI), which is a new industry
    standard intended to eventually replace the legacy BIOS as the primary
    interface for bootstrapping computers and certain system services
    later.</para>

    <para>By default, VirtualBox uses the BIOS firmware for virtual machines.
    To use EFI for a given virtual machine, you can enable EFI in the
    machine's "Settings" dialog (see <xref linkend="settings-motherboard" />).
    Alternatively, use the <computeroutput>VBoxManage</computeroutput> command
    line interface like this: <screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --firmware efi</screen>
    To switch back to using the BIOS, use: <screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --firmware bios</screen>One
    notable user of EFI is Apple's Mac OS X, but more recent Linuxes
    and Windows (starting with Vista) offer special versions that can be
    booted using EFI as well.</para>

    <para>Another possible use of EFI in VirtualBox is development and testing
    of EFI applications, without booting any OS.</para>

    <para>Note that the VirtualBox EFI support is experimental and will be
      enhanced as EFI matures and becomes more widespread. Mac OS X, Linux
      and newer Windows guests are known to work fine. Windows 7 guests are
      unable to boot with the VirtualBox EFI implementation.</para>

    <sect2 id="efividmode">
      <title>Video modes in EFI</title>

      <para>EFI provides two distinct video interfaces: GOP (Graphics Output
      Protocol) and UGA (Universal Graphics Adapter). Modern operating systems
      (such as Mac OS X) generally use GOP, while some older ones still use
      UGA. VirtualBox provides a configuration option to control the
      graphics resolution for both interfaces, making the difference mostly
      irrelevant for users.</para>

      <para>The default resolution is 1024x768. To select a graphics resolution
      for EFI, use the following <computeroutput>VBoxManage</computeroutput>
      command:
      <screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" VBoxInternal2/EfiGraphicsResolution HxV</screen>
      Determine the horizontal resolution H and the vertical resolution V from
      the following list of default resolutions:</para>
