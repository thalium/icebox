  <para>VirtualBox version numbers consist of three numbers separated by dots
  where the first and second number represent the major version and the 3rd number
  the minor version. Minor version numbers of official releases are always even.
  An odd minor version number represents an internal development or test build.
  In addition, each build contains a revision number.</para>
