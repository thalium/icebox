  <sect1 id="vrde">
    <title>Remote display (VRDP support)</title>

    <para>VirtualBox can display virtual machines remotely, meaning that a
    virtual machine can execute on one computer even though the machine will be
    displayed on a second computer, and the machine will be controlled from
    there as well, as if the virtual machine was running on that second
    computer.</para>

    <para>For maximum flexibility, starting with VirtualBox 4.0, VirtualBox
    implements remote machine display through a generic extension interface,
    the VirtualBox Remote Desktop Extension (VRDE). The base open-source
    VirtualBox package only provides this interface, while implementations can
    be supplied by third parties with VirtualBox extension packages, which
    must be installed separately from the base package. See <xref
    linkend="intro-installing" /> for more information.</para>

    <para>Oracle provides support for the <emphasis role="bold">VirtualBox
    Remote Display Protocol (VRDP)</emphasis> in such a VirtualBox extension
    package. When this package is installed, VirtualBox versions 4.0 and later
    support VRDP the same way as binary (non-open-source) versions of
    VirtualBox before 4.0 did.</para>

    <para>VRDP is a backwards-compatible extension to Microsoft's Remote
    Desktop Protocol (RDP). As a result, you can use any standard RDP client
    to control the remote VM.</para>

    <para>Even when the extension is installed, the VRDP server is disabled by
    default. It can easily be enabled on a per-VM basis either in the
    VirtualBox Manager in the "Display" settings (see <xref
    linkend="settings-display" />) or with
    <computeroutput>VBoxManage</computeroutput>:<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --vrde on</screen></para>

    <para>By default, the VRDP server uses TCP port
    <computeroutput>3389</computeroutput>. You will need to change the
    default port if you run more than one VRDP server, since the port can
    only be used by one server at a time; you might also need to change it
    on Windows hosts since the default port might already be used by the RDP
    server that is built into Windows itself. Ports 5000 through 5050 are
    typically not used and might be a good choice.</para>

    <para>The port can be changed either in the "Display" settings of the
    graphical user interface or with
    <computeroutput>--vrdeport</computeroutput> option of the
    <computeroutput>VBoxManage modifyvm</computeroutput> command. You can
    specify a comma-separated list of ports or ranges of ports. Use a dash
    between two port numbers to specify a range. The VRDP server will bind
    to <emphasis role="bold">one</emphasis> of available ports from the
    specified list. For example, <computeroutput>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM
    name" --vrdeport 5000,5010-5012</computeroutput> will configure the
    server to bind to one of the ports 5000, 5010, 5011 or 5012. See <xref
    linkend="vboxmanage-modifyvm-vrde" /> for details.</para>

    <para>The actual port used by a running VM can be either queried with
    <computeroutput>VBoxManage showvminfo</computeroutput> command or seen
    in the GUI on the "Runtime" tab of the "Session Information Dialog",
    which is accessible via the "Machine" menu of the VM window.</para>

    <para>Support for IPv6 has been implemented in VirtualBox 4.3.
    If the host OS supports IPv6 the VRDP server will automatically
    listen for IPv6 connections in addition to IPv4.</para>

    <sect2 id="rdp-viewers">
      <title>Common third-party RDP viewers</title>

      <para>Since VRDP is backwards-compatible to RDP, you can use any
      standard RDP viewer to connect to such a remote virtual machine
      (examples follow below). For this to work, you must specify the
      <emphasis role="bold">IP address</emphasis> of your
      <emphasis>host</emphasis> system (not of the virtual machine!) as the
      server address to connect to, as well as the <emphasis role="bold">port
      number</emphasis> that the VRDP server is using.</para>

      <para>Here follow examples for the most common RDP viewers:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>On Windows, you can use the Microsoft Terminal Services
            Connector (<computeroutput>mstsc.exe</computeroutput>) that ships
            with Windows. You can start it by bringing up the "Run" dialog
            (press the Windows key and "R") and typing "mstsc". You can also
            find it under "Start" &rarr; "All Programs" &rarr; "Accessories"
            &rarr; "Remote Desktop Connection". If you use the "Run" dialog,
            you can type in options directly:<screen>mstsc 1.2.3.4:3389</screen></para>

            <para>Replace <computeroutput>1.2.3.4</computeroutput> with the host IP address,
            and <computeroutput>3389</computeroutput> with a different port if necessary.</para>

            <note>
              <para>IPv6 address must be enclosed in square brackets to specify a port.
              For example: <computeroutput>mstsc [fe80::1:2:3:4]:3389</computeroutput></para>
            </note>

              <computeroutput>localhost</computeroutput> and
              <computeroutput>127.0.0.1</computeroutput> might not work using
              <computeroutput>mstsc.exe</computeroutput>. Instead, the address
              <computeroutput>127.0.0.2[:3389]</computeroutput> has to be
              used.</para>
            </note>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>On other systems, you can use the standard open-source
            <computeroutput>rdesktop</computeroutput> program. This ships with
            most Linux distributions, but VirtualBox also comes with a
            modified variant of rdesktop for remote USB support (see <xref
            linkend="usb-over-rdp" /> below).</para>

            <para>With rdesktop, use a command line such as the
            following:<screen>rdesktop -a 16 -N 1.2.3.4:3389</screen></para>

            <para>As said for the Microsoft viewer above, replace <computeroutput>1.2.3.4</computeroutput>
            with the host IP address, and <computeroutput>3389</computeroutput> with a different port if
            necessary. The <computeroutput>-a 16</computeroutput> option
            requests a color depth of 16 bits per pixel, which we recommend.
            (For best performance, after installation of the guest operating
            system, you should set its display color depth to the same value).
            The <computeroutput>-N</computeroutput> option enables use of the
            NumPad keys.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>If you run the KDE desktop, you might prefer
            <computeroutput>krdc</computeroutput>, the KDE RDP viewer. The
            command line would look like this:<screen>krdc rdp://1.2.3.4:3389</screen></para>

            <para>Again, replace <computeroutput>1.2.3.4</computeroutput> with the host IP address,
            and <computeroutput>3389</computeroutput> with a different port if necessary.
            The "rdp://" bit is required with krdc to switch it into RDP mode.</para>

    <sect2 id="vboxheadless">
      <title>VBoxHeadless, the remote desktop server</title>

      <para>While any VM started from the VirtualBox Manager is capable of
      running virtual machines remotely, it is not convenient to have to run
      the full-fledged GUI if you never want to have VMs displayed locally in
      the first place. In particular, if you are running server hardware whose
      only purpose is to host VMs, and all your VMs are supposed to run
      remotely over VRDP, then it is pointless to have a graphical user
      interface on the server at all -- especially since, on a Linux or
      Solaris host, the VirtualBox manager comes with dependencies on the Qt
      and SDL libraries. This is inconvenient if you would rather not have the
      X Window system on your server at all.</para>

      <para>VirtualBox therefore comes with yet another front-end called
      <computeroutput>VBoxHeadless</computeroutput>, which produces no visible
      output on the host at all, but still can deliver VRDP data. This
      front-end has no dependencies on the X Window system on Linux and
      Solaris hosts.<footnote>
          <para>Before VirtualBox 1.6, the headless server was called
          <computeroutput>VBoxVRDP</computeroutput>. For the sake of backwards
          compatibility, the VirtualBox installation still installs an
          executable with that name as well.</para>
        </footnote></para>

      <para>To start a virtual machine with
      <computeroutput>VBoxHeadless</computeroutput>, you have three
      options:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>You can use <screen>VBoxManage startvm "VM name" --type headless</screen>The
          extra <computeroutput>--type</computeroutput> option causes
          VirtualBox to use <computeroutput>VBoxHeadless</computeroutput> as
          the front-end to the internal virtualization engine instead of the
          Qt front-end.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>One alternative is to use
          <computeroutput>VBoxHeadless</computeroutput> directly, as
          follows:<screen>VBoxHeadless --startvm &lt;uuid|name&gt;</screen></para>

          <para>This way of starting the VM helps troubleshooting problems
          reported by <computeroutput>VBoxManage startvm ...</computeroutput>
          because you can see sometimes more detailed error messages,
          especially for early failures before the VM execution is started.
          In normal situations <computeroutput>VBoxManage startvm</computeroutput>
          is preferred since it runs the VM directly as a background process
          which has to be done explicitly when directly starting
          <computeroutput>VBoxHeadless</computeroutput>.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The other alternative is to start
          <computeroutput>VBoxHeadless</computeroutput> from the VirtualBox
          Manager GUI, by holding the Shift key when starting a virtual
          machine or selecting <computeroutput>Headless Start</computeroutput>
          from the <computeroutput>Machine</computeroutput> menu.
          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Since VirtualBox version 5.0, when you use
      <computeroutput>VBoxHeadless</computeroutput> to start a VM,
      the VRDP server will be enabled according to the VM configuration.
      You can override the VM's setting using <computeroutput>--vrde</computeroutput>
      command line parameter. To enable the VRDP server start the VM like
      this:<screen>VBoxHeadless --startvm &lt;uuid|name&gt; --vrde on</screen>
      and to disable it:<screen>VBoxHeadless --startvm &lt;uuid|name&gt; --vrde off</screen>
      To have the VRDP server enabled depending on the VM configuration, as the
      other front-ends would, you can still use:
      <screen>VBoxHeadless --startvm &lt;uuid|name&gt; --vrde config</screen>
      but this is the same as <screen>VBoxHeadless --startvm &lt;uuid|name&gt;</screen></para>

      <para>If you start the VM with <computeroutput>VBoxManage startvm ...</computeroutput>
      then the configuration settings of the VM are always used.</para>

      <title>Remote USB</title>

      <para>As a special feature on top of the VRDP support, VirtualBox
      supports remote USB devices over the wire as well. That is, the
      VirtualBox guest that runs on one computer can access the USB devices of
      the remote computer on which the VRDP data is being displayed the same
      way as USB devices that are connected to the actual host. This allows
      for running virtual machines on a VirtualBox host that acts as a server,
      where a client can connect from elsewhere that needs only a network
      adapter and a display capable of running an RDP viewer. When USB devices
      are plugged into the client, the remote VirtualBox server can access
      them.</para>

      <para>For these remote USB devices, the same filter rules apply as for
      other USB devices, as described with <xref linkend="settings-usb" />.
      All you have to do is specify "Remote" (or "Any") when setting up these
      rules.</para>

      <para>Accessing remote USB devices is only possible if the RDP client
      supports this extension. On Linux and Solaris hosts, the VirtualBox
      installation provides a suitable VRDP client called
      <computeroutput>rdesktop-vrdp</computeroutput>. Recent versions of
      <computeroutput>uttsc</computeroutput>, a client tailored for the use
      with Sun Ray thin clients, also support accessing remote USB devices.
      RDP clients for other platforms will be provided in future VirtualBox
      versions.</para>

      <para>To make a remote USB device available to a VM,
      <computeroutput>rdesktop-vrdp</computeroutput> should be started as
      follows:<screen>rdesktop-vrdp -r usb -a 16 -N my.host.address</screen>
      Please refer to <xref linkend="ts_usb-linux" /> for further details on how
      to properly set up the permissions for USB devices. Furthermore it is
      advisable to
      disable automatic loading of any host driver on the remote host which
      might work on USB devices to ensure that the devices are accessible by
      the RDP client. If the setup was properly done on the remote host,
      plug/unplug events are visible on the VBox.log file of the VM.</para>

            <para>Historically, RDP4 authentication was used, with which the
            RDP client does not perform any checks in order to verify the
            identity of the server it connects to. Since user credentials can
            be obtained using a "man in the middle" (MITM) attack, RDP4
            authentication is insecure and should generally not be
            used.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>RDP5.1 authentication employs a server certificate for which
            the client possesses the public key. This way it is guaranteed
            that the server possess the corresponding private key. However, as
            this hard-coded private key became public some years ago, RDP5.1
            authentication is also insecure.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>RDP5.2 authentication uses the Enhanced RDP Security, which
            means that an external security protocol is used to secure the
            connection. RDP4 and RDP5.1 use Standard RDP Security.
            The VRDP server supports Enhanced RDP Security with TLS protocol and,
            as a part of TLS handshake, sends the server certificate to the

                  and Standard RDP Security connections are allowed. The security
                  method is negotiated with the client. This is the default setting.

            For example the following command allows a client to use either Standard

            used by the server, if the client supports TLS. However, in order to use TLS

      <title>VRDP video redirection</title>

      <para>Starting with VirtualBox 3.2, the VRDP server can redirect video
      streams from the guest to the RDP client. Video frames are compressed
      using the JPEG algorithm allowing a higher compression ratio than
      standard RDP bitmap compression methods. It is possible to increase the
      compression ratio by lowering the video quality.</para>

      <para>The VRDP server automatically detects video streams in a guest as
      frequently updated rectangular areas. As a result, this method works
      with any guest operating system without having to install additional
      software in the guest; in particular, the Guest Additions are not
      required.</para>

      <para>On the client side, however, currently only the Windows 7 Remote
      Desktop Connection client supports this feature. If a client does not

      updates.</para>

      <para>The following command enables video redirection: <screen>VBoxManage modifyvm "VM name" --vrdevideochannel on</screen></para>

      <para>The quality of the video is defined as a value from 10 to 100

  <sect1 id="teleporting">
    <title>Teleporting</title>

    <para>Starting with version 3.1, VirtualBox supports "teleporting" -- that
    is, moving a virtual machine over a network from one VirtualBox host to
    another, while the virtual machine is running. This works regardless of
    the host operating system that is running on the hosts: you can teleport
    virtual machines between Solaris and Mac hosts, for example.</para>

    <para>Teleporting requires that a machine be currently running on one
    host, which is then called the <emphasis role="bold">"source"</emphasis>.
    The host to which the virtual machine will be teleported will then be
    called the <emphasis role="bold">"target"</emphasis>; the machine on the
    target is then configured to wait for the source to contact the target.
    The machine's running state will then be transferred from the source to
    the target with minimal downtime.</para>

    <para>Teleporting happens over any TCP/IP network; the source and the
    target only need to agree on a TCP/IP port which is specified in the
    teleporting settings.</para>

    <para>At this time, there are a few prerequisites for this to work,
    however:<orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>On the target host, you must configure a virtual machine in
          VirtualBox with exactly the same hardware settings as the machine on
          the source that you want to teleport. This does not apply to
          settings which are merely descriptive, such as the VM name, but
          obviously for teleporting to work, the target machine must have the
          same amount of memory and other hardware settings. Otherwise
          teleporting will fail with an error message.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The two virtual machines on the source and the target must
          share the same storage (hard disks as well as floppy and CD/DVD
          images). This means that they either use the same iSCSI targets or
          that the storage resides somewhere on the network and both hosts
          have access to it via NFS or SMB/CIFS.</para>

          <para>This also means that neither the source nor the target machine
          can have any snapshots.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist></para>

    <para>Then perform the following steps:<orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>On the <emphasis>target</emphasis> host, configure the virtual
          machine to wait for a teleport request to arrive when it is started,
          instead of actually attempting to start the machine. This is done
          with the following VBoxManage command:<screen>VBoxManage modifyvm &lt;targetvmname&gt; --teleporter on --teleporterport &lt;port&gt;</screen></para>

          <para>where <computeroutput>&lt;targetvmname&gt;</computeroutput> is
          the name of the virtual machine on the target host and
          <computeroutput>&lt;port&gt;</computeroutput> is a TCP/IP port
          number to be used on both the source and the target hosts. For
          example, use 6000. For details, see <xref
          linkend="vboxmanage-modifyvm-teleport" />.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Start the VM on the target host. You will see that instead of
          actually running, it will show a progress dialog. indicating that it
          is waiting for a teleport request to arrive.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Start the machine on the <emphasis>source</emphasis> host as
          usual. When it is running and you want it to be teleported, issue
          the following command on the source host:<screen>VBoxManage controlvm &lt;sourcevmname&gt; teleport --host &lt;targethost&gt; --port &lt;port&gt;</screen></para>

          <para>where <computeroutput>&lt;sourcevmname&gt;</computeroutput> is
          the name of the virtual machine on the source host (the machine that
          is currently running),
          <computeroutput>&lt;targethost&gt;</computeroutput> is the host or
          IP name of the target host on which the machine is waiting for the
          teleport request, and <computeroutput>&lt;port&gt;</computeroutput>
          must be the same number as specified in the command on the target
          host. For details, see <xref
          linkend="vboxmanage-controlvm" />.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist></para>

    <para>For testing, you can also teleport machines on the same host; in
    that case, use "localhost" as the hostname on both the source and the
    target host.<note>
        <para>In rare cases, if the CPUs of the source and the target are very
        different, teleporting can fail with an error message, or the target
        may hang. This may happen especially if the VM is running application
        software that is highly optimized to run on a particular CPU without
        correctly checking that certain CPU features are actually present.
        VirtualBox filters what CPU capabilities are presented to the guest
        operating system. Advanced users can attempt to restrict these virtual
        CPU capabilities with the <computeroutput>VBoxManage --modifyvm
        --cpuid</computeroutput> command; see <xref
        linkend="vboxmanage-modifyvm-teleport" />.</para>
