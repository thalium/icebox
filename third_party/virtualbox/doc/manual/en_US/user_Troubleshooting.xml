      <title>Categorizing and isolating problems</title>

      <para>More often than not, a virtualized guest behaves like a physical
      system. Any problems that a physical machine would encounter, a virtual
      machine will encounter as well. If, for example, Internet connectivity
      is lost due to external issues, virtual machines will be affected just
      as much as physical ones.</para>

      <para>If a true VirtualBox problem is encountered, it helps to
      categorize and isolate the problem first. Here are some of the questions
      that should be answered before reporting a problem:<orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Is the problem specific to a certain guest OS? Specific
            release of a guest OS? Especially with Linux guest related
            problems, the issue may be specific to a certain distribution and
            version of Linux.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Is the problem specific to a certain host OS? Problems are
            usually not host OS specific (because most of the VirtualBox code
            base is shared across all supported platforms), but especially in
            the areas of networking and USB support, there are significant
            differences between host platforms. Some GUI related issues are
            also host specific.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Is the problem specific to certain host hardware? This
            category of issues is typically related to the host CPU. Because
            of significant differences between VT-x and AMD-V, problems may be
            specific to one or the other technology. The exact CPU model may
            also make a difference (even for software virtualization) because
            different CPUs support different features, which may affect
            certain aspects of guest CPU operation.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Is the problem specific to a certain virtualization mode?
            Some problems may only occur in software virtualization mode,
            others may be specific to hardware virtualization.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Is the problem specific to guest SMP? That is, is it related
            to the number of virtual CPUs (VCPUs) in the guest? Using more
            than one CPU usually significantly affects the internal operation
            of a guest OS.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Is the problem specific to the Guest Additions? In some
            cases, this is a given (e.g., a shared folders problem), in other
            cases it may be less obvious (for example, display problems). And
            if the problem is Guest Additions specific, is it also specific to
            a certain version of the Additions?</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Is the problem specific to a certain environment? Some
            problems are related to a particular environment external to the
            VM; this usually involves network setup. Certain configurations of
            external servers such as DHCP or PXE may expose problems which do
            not occur with other, similar servers.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Is the problem a regression? Knowing that an issue is a
            regression usually makes it significantly easier to find the
            solution. In this case, it is crucial to know which version is
            affected and which is not.</para>

    <sect2 id="collect-debug-info">
      <title>Collecting debugging information</title>

      <para>For problem determination, it is often important to collect
      debugging information which can be analyzed by VirtualBox support. This
      section contains information about what kind of information can be
      obtained.</para>

      <para>Every time VirtualBox starts up a VM, a so-called <emphasis
      role="bold">"release log file"</emphasis> is created containing lots of
      information about the VM configuration and runtime events. The log file
      is called <computeroutput><literal>VBox.log</literal></computeroutput>
      and resides in the VM log file folder. Typically this will be a
      directory like this:<screen>$HOME/VirtualBox VMs/{machinename}/Logs</screen></para>

      <para>When starting a VM, the configuration file of the last run will be
      renamed to <computeroutput>.1</computeroutput>, up to
      <computeroutput>.3</computeroutput>. Sometimes when there is a problem,
      it is useful to have a look at the logs. Also when requesting support
      for VirtualBox, supplying the corresponding log file is
      mandatory.</para>

      <para>For convenience, for each virtual machine, the VirtualBox main
      window can show these logs in a window. To access it, select a virtual
      machine from the list on the left and select "Show logs..." from the
      "Machine" window.</para>

      <para>The release log file (VBox.log) contains a wealth of diagnostic
      information, such as Host OS type and version, VirtualBox version and
      build (32-bit or 64-bit), a complete dump of the guest's configuration
      (CFGM), detailed information about the host CPU type and supported
      features, whether hardware virtualization is enabled, information about
      VT-x/AMD-V setup, state transitions (creating, running, paused,
      stopping, etc.), guest BIOS messages, Guest Additions messages,
      device-specific log entries and, at the end of execution, final guest
      state and condensed statistics.</para>

      <para>In case of crashes, it is very important to collect <emphasis
      role="bold">crash dumps</emphasis>. This is true for both host and guest
      crashes. For information about enabling core dumps on Linux, Solaris,
      and OS X systems, refer to the core dump article on the VirtualBox
      website.<footnote>
          <para><ulink
          url="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Core_dump">http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Core_dump</ulink>.</para>
        </footnote></para>

      <para>You can also use <computeroutput>VBoxManage
      debugvm</computeroutput> to create a dump of a complete virtual machine;
      see <xref linkend="vboxmanage-debugvm" />.</para>

      <para>For network related problems, it is often helpful to capture a
      trace of network traffic. If the traffic is routed through an adapter on
      the host, it is possible to use Wireshark or a similar tool to capture
      the traffic there. However, this often also includes a lot of traffic
      unrelated to the VM.</para>

      <para>VirtualBox provides an ability to capture network traffic only on
      a specific VM's network adapter. Refer to the network tracing article on
      the VirtualBox website<footnote>
          <para><ulink
          url="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Network_tips">http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Network_tips</ulink>.</para>
        </footnote> for information on enabling this capture. The trace files
      created by VirtualBox are in <computeroutput>.pcap</computeroutput>
      format and can be easily analyzed with Wireshark.</para>

    <sect2 id="ts_debugger">
      <title>The built-in VM debugger</title>

      <para>VirtualBox includes a built-in VM debugger, which advanced users
      may find useful. This debugger allows for examining and, to some extent,
      controlling the VM state.<warning>
          <para>Use the VM debugger at your own risk. There is no support for
          it, and the following documentation is only made available for
          advanced users with a very high level of familiarity with the
          x86/AMD64 machine instruction set, as well as detailed knowledge of
          the PC architecture. A degree of familiarity with the internals of
          the guest OS in question may also be very helpful.</para>
        </warning></para>

      <para>The VM debugger is available in all regular production versions of
      VirtualBox, but it is disabled by default because the average user will
      have little use for it. There are two ways to access the
      debugger:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>A debugger console window displayed alongside the VM</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Via the <computeroutput>telnet</computeroutput> protocol at
            port 5000</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>The debugger can be enabled in three ways:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Start the VM directly using <computeroutput>VirtualBox
            --startvm</computeroutput>, with an additional
            <computeroutput>--dbg</computeroutput>,
            <computeroutput>--debug</computeroutput>, or
            <computeroutput>--debug-command-line</computeroutput> argument.
            See the VirtualBox usage help for details.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Set the
            <computeroutput>VBOX_GUI_DBG_ENABLED</computeroutput> or
            <computeroutput>VBOX_GUI_DBG_AUTO_SHOW</computeroutput>
            environment variable to <computeroutput>true</computeroutput>
            before launching the VirtualBox process. Setting these variables
            (only their presence is checked) is effective even when the first
            VirtualBox process is the VM selector window. VMs subsequently
            launched from the selector will have the debugger enabled.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Set the <computeroutput>GUI/Dbg/Enabled</computeroutput>
            extra data item to <computeroutput>true</computeroutput> before
            launching the VM. This can be set globally or on a per VM
            basis.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>A new 'Debug' menu entry will be added to the VirtualBox
      application. This menu allows the user to open the debugger
      console.</para>

      <para>The VM debugger command syntax is loosely modeled on Microsoft and
      IBM debuggers used on DOS, OS/2 and Windows. Users familiar with symdeb,
      CodeView, or the OS/2 kernel debugger will find the VirtualBox VM
      debugger familiar.</para>

      <para>The most important command is
      <computeroutput>help</computeroutput>. This will print brief usage help
      for all debugger commands. The set of commands supported by the VM
      debugger changes frequently and the
      <computeroutput>help</computeroutput> command is always
      up-to-date.</para>

      <para>A brief summary of frequently used commands follows:<itemizedlist>

        </itemizedlist></para>

      <para>See the built-in <computeroutput>help</computeroutput> for other
      available commands.</para>

      <para>The VM debugger supports symbolic debugging, although symbols for
      guest code are often not available. For Solaris guests, the
      <computeroutput>detect</computeroutput> command automatically determines
      the guest OS version and locates kernel symbols in guest's memory.
      Symbolic debugging is then available. For Linux guests, the
      <computeroutput>detect</computeroutput> commands also determines the
      guest OS version, but there are no symbols in the guest's memory. Kernel
      symbols are available in the file
      <computeroutput>/proc/kallsyms</computeroutput> on Linux guests. This
      file must be copied to the host, for example using
      <computeroutput>scp</computeroutput>. The
      <computeroutput>loadmap</computeroutput> debugger command can be used to
      make the symbol information available to the VM debugger. Note that the
      <computeroutput>kallsyms</computeroutput> file contains the symbols for
      the currently loaded modules; if the guest's configuration changes, the
      symbols will change as well and must be updated.</para>

      <para>For all guests, a simple way to verify that the correct symbols
      are loaded is the <computeroutput>k</computeroutput> command. The guest
      is normally idling and it should be clear from the symbolic information
      that the guest operating system's idle loop is being executed.</para>

      <para>Another group of debugger commands is the set of
      <computeroutput>info</computeroutput> commands. Running
      <computeroutput>info help</computeroutput> provides complete usage
      information. The information commands provide ad-hoc data pertinent to
      various emulated devices and aspects of the VMM. There is no general
      guideline for using the <computeroutput>info</computeroutput> commands,
      the right command to use depends entirely on the problem being
      investigated. Some of the info commands are:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><computeroutput>cfgm</computeroutput> -- print a branch of
            the configuration tree</para>
          </listitem>

      <para>The output of the <computeroutput>info</computeroutput> commands
      generally requires in-depth knowledge of the emulated device and/or
      VirtualBox VMM internals. However, when used properly, the information
      provided can be invaluable.</para>

    <sect2 id="ts_config-periodic-flush">
      <title>Guest shows IDE/SATA errors for file-based images on slow host
      file system</title>

      <para>Occasionally, some host file systems provide very poor writing
      performance and as a consequence cause the guest to time out IDE/SATA
      commands. This is normal behavior and should normally cause no real
      problems, as the guest should repeat commands that have timed out.
      However, some guests (e.g. some Linux versions) have severe problems if a
      write to an image file takes longer than about 15 seconds. Some file
      systems however require more than a minute to complete a single write,
      if the host cache contains a large amount of data that needs to be
      written.</para>

      <para>The symptom for this problem is that the guest can no longer
      access its files during large write or copying operations, usually
      leading to an immediate hang of the guest.</para>

      <para>In order to work around this problem (the true fix is to use a
      faster file system that doesn't exhibit such unacceptable write
      performance), it is possible to flush the image file after a certain
      amount of data has been written. This interval is normally infinite, but
      can be configured individually for each disk of a VM.</para>

      <para>For IDE disks use the following command:</para>

      <screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name"

      <para>For SATA disks use the following command:</para>

      <screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name"
      "VBoxInternal/Devices/ahci/0/LUN#[x]/Config/FlushInterval" [b]</screen>

      <para>The value [x] that selects the disk for IDE is 0 for the master
      device on the first channel, 1 for the slave device on the first
      channel, 2 for the master device on the second channel or 3 for the
      master device on the second channel. For SATA use values between 0 and
      29. Only disks support this configuration option; it must not be set for
      CD/DVD drives.</para>

      <para>The unit of the interval [b] is the number of bytes written since
      the last flush. The value for it must be selected so that the occasional
      long write delays do not occur. Since the proper flush interval depends
      on the performance of the host and the host filesystem, finding the
      optimal value that makes the problem disappear requires some
      experimentation. Values between 1000000 and 10000000 (1 to 10 megabytes)
      are a good starting point. Decreasing the interval both decreases the
      probability of the problem and the write performance of the guest.
      Setting the value unnecessarily low will cost performance without
      providing any benefits. An interval of 1 will cause a flush for each
      write operation and should solve the problem in any case, but has a
      severe write performance penalty.</para>

      <para>Providing a value of 0 for [b] is treated as an infinite flush
      interval, effectively disabling this workaround. Removing the extra data
      key by specifying no value for [b] has the same effect.</para>

      <title>Responding to guest IDE/SATA flush requests</title>

      <para>If desired, the virtual disk images can be flushed when the guest
      issues the IDE FLUSH CACHE command. Normally these requests are ignored
      for improved performance. The parameters below are only accepted for
      disk drives. They must not be set for DVD drives.</para>

      <para>To enable flushing for IDE disks, issue the following
      command:</para>

      <screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" "VBoxInternal/Devices/piix3ide/0/LUN#[x]/Config/IgnoreFlush" 0</screen>

      <para>The value [x] that selects the disk is 0 for the master device on
      the first channel, 1 for the slave device on the first channel, 2 for
      the master device on the second channel or 3 for the master device on
      the second channel.</para>

      <para>To enable flushing for SATA disks, issue the following

      <screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" "VBoxInternal/Devices/ahci/0/LUN#[x]/Config/IgnoreFlush" 0</screen>

      <para>The value [x] that selects the disk can be a value between 0 and

    <sect2 id="ts_host-freq-boost">
      <title>Performance variation with frequency boosting</title>

      <para>
          Many newer multi-core processors support some form of frequency
          boosting, which means that if only one core is utilized, it can run
          faster (possibly 50% faster or even more) than the rated CPU frequency.
          This causes measured performance to vary somewhat as a function of the
          momentary overall system load. The exact behavior depends strongly
          on the specific processor model.
      </para>

      <para>
          As a consequence, benchmarking on systems which utilize frequency
          boosting may produce unstable and non-repeatable results, especially
          if benchmark runs are short (on the order of seconds). To obtain stable
          results, benchmarks must be run over longer periods of time and with a
          constant system load apart from the VM being tested.

      <title>Frequency scaling effect on CPU usage</title>

      <para>
          On some hardware platforms and operating systems, CPU frequency
          scaling may cause CPU usage reporting to be highly misleading. This
          happens in situations when the host CPU load is significant but not
          heavy, such as 15-30% of the maximum.
      </para>

      <para>
          Most operating systems determine CPU usage in terms of time spent,
          measuring for example how many nanoseconds the systems or a process
          was active within one second. However, in order to save energy, modern
          systems can significantly scale down CPU speed when the system is not
          fully loaded. Naturally, when the CPU is running at (for example) one
          half of its maximum speed, the same number of instructions will take
          roughly twice as long to execute compared to running at full speed.
      </para>

      <para>
          Depending on the specific hardware and host OS, this effect can very
          significantly skew the CPU usage reported by the OS; the reported CPU
          usage can be several times higher than what it would have been had the
          CPU been running at full speed. The effect can be observed both on
          the host OS and in a guest OS.

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>These problems are all caused by a bug in the hard disk driver of
      Windows 2000. After issuing a hard disk request, there is a race
      condition in the Windows driver code which leads to corruption if the
      operation completes too fast, i.e. the hardware interrupt from the IDE
      controller arrives too soon. With physical hardware, there is a
      guaranteed delay in most systems so the problem is usually hidden there
      (however it should be possible to reproduce it on physical hardware as
      well). In a virtual environment, it is possible for the operation to be
      done immediately (especially on very fast systems with multiple CPUs)
      and the interrupt is signaled sooner than on a physical system. The
      solution is to introduce an artificial delay before delivering such
      interrupts. This delay can be configured for a VM using the following
      command:</para>

      <screen>VBoxManage setextradata "VM name" "VBoxInternal/Devices/piix3ide/0/Config/IRQDelay" 1</screen>

      <para>This sets the delay to one millisecond. In case this doesn't help,
      increase it to a value between 1 and 5 milliseconds. Please note that
      this slows down disk performance. After installation, you should be able
      to remove the key (or set it to 0).</para>

      <para>VirtualBox Guest Additions for Windows prior to 4.1.8 did not properly

          With the basic Direct3D support all Direct3D 8.0 and Direct3D 9.0

          and Direct3D 9.0 applications. As a result of the above mentioned system
          files corruption these applications will not work anymore. See below for
          a step-by-step guide for restoring the original d3d8.dll and d3d9.dll

      <title>Windows 3.x limited to 64 MB RAM</title>

      <para>Windows 3.x guests are typically limited to 64 MB RAM, even if a VM is assigned
      much more memory. While Windows 3.1 is theoretically capable of using up to 512 MB RAM,
      it only uses memory available through the XMS interface. Versions of HIMEM.SYS (the
      Microsoft XMS manager) shipped with MS-DOS and Microsoft Windows 3.x can only use
      up to 64 MB on standard PCs.</para>

      <para>This is a HIMEM.SYS limitation documented by Microsoft in Knowledge base
      article KB 116256.
      Windows 3.1 memory limits are described in detail in Microsoft Knowledge base
      article KB 84388.</para>

      <para>It is possible for Windows 3.x guests to utilize more than 64 MB RAM if a
      different XMS provider is used. That could be a newer HIMEM.SYS version (such as
      that shipped with Windows 98), or a more capable third-party memory manager
      (such as QEMM).</para>

      <para>Some Linux guests may cause a high CPU load even if the guest
      system appears to be idle. This can be caused by a high timer frequency
      of the guest kernel. Some Linux distributions, for example Fedora, ship
      a Linux kernel configured for a timer frequency of <emphasis

      <para>Linux kernels shipped with Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) as of
      release 4.7 and 5.1 as well as kernels of related Linux distributions
      (for instance CentOS and Oracle Linux) support a kernel
      parameter <emphasis>divider=N</emphasis>. Hence, such kernels support a
      lower timer frequency without recompilation. We suggest to add the

      share a common configuration among different virtual machine processes
      and provide several user interface options based on a common
      architecture. All global status information and configuration is
      maintained by the process <computeroutput>VBoxSVC.exe</computeroutput>,
      which is an out-of-process COM server. Whenever a VirtualBox process is
      started, it requests access to the COM server and Windows automatically
      starts the process. Note that it should never be started by the end
      user.</para>

      <para>When the last process disconnects from the COM server, it will
      terminate itself after some seconds. The VirtualBox configuration (XML
      files) is maintained and owned by the COM server and the files are
      locked whenever the server runs.</para>

      <para>In some cases - such as when a virtual machine is terminated
      unexpectedly - the COM server will not notice that the client is
      disconnected and stay active for a longer period (10 minutes or so)
      keeping the configuration files locked. In other rare cases the COM
      server might experience an internal error and subsequently other

      <title>Strange guest IDE error messages when writing to CD/DVD</title>

      <para>If the experimental CD/DVD writer support is enabled with an
      incorrect VirtualBox, host or guest configuration, it is possible that
      any attempt to access the CD/DVD writer fails and simply results in
      guest kernel error messages (for Linux guests) or application error
      messages (for Windows guests). VirtualBox performs the usual consistency
      checks when a VM is powered up (in particular it aborts with an error
      message if the device for the CD/DVD writer is not writable by the user
      starting the VM), but it cannot detect all misconfigurations. The
      necessary host and guest OS configuration is not specific for
      VirtualBox, but a few frequent problems are listed here which occurred
      in connection with VirtualBox.</para>

      <para>Special care must be taken to use the correct device. The
      configured host CD/DVD device file name (in most cases
      <literal>/dev/cdrom</literal>) must point to the device that allows
      writing to the CD/DVD unit. For CD/DVD writer units connected to a SCSI
      controller or to a IDE controller that interfaces to the Linux SCSI
      subsystem (common for some SATA controllers), this must refer to the
      SCSI device node (e.g. <literal>/dev/scd0</literal>). Even for IDE
      CD/DVD writer units this must refer to the appropriate SCSI CD-ROM
      device node (e.g. <literal>/dev/scd0</literal>) if the
      <literal>ide-scsi</literal> kernel module is loaded. This module is
      required for CD/DVD writer support with all Linux 2.4 kernels and some
      early 2.6 kernels. Many Linux distributions load this module whenever a
      CD/DVD writer is detected in the system, even if the kernel would
      support CD/DVD writers without the module. VirtualBox supports the use
      of IDE device files (e.g. <literal>/dev/hdc</literal>), provided the
      kernel supports this and the <literal>ide-scsi</literal> module is not
      loaded.</para>

      <para>Similar rules (except that within the guest the CD/DVD writer is
      always an IDE device) apply to the guest configuration. Since this setup
      is very common, it is likely that the default configuration of the guest
      works as expected.</para>

      <title>Linux kernel vmalloc pool exhausted</title>

      <para>When running a large number of VMs with a lot of RAM on a Linux
      system (say 20 VMs with 1 GB of RAM each), additional VMs might fail to
      start with a kernel error saying that the vmalloc pool is exhausted and
      should be extended. The error message also tells you to specify
      <computeroutput>vmalloc=256MB</computeroutput> in your kernel parameter
      list. If adding this parameter to your GRUB or LILO configuration makes
      the kernel fail to boot (with a weird error message such as "failed to
      mount the root partition"), then you have probably run into a memory
      conflict of your kernel and initial RAM disk. This can be solved by
      adding the following parameter to your GRUB configuration:</para>

      <title>Cannot start VM, not enough contiguous memory</title>

      <para>The ZFS file system is known to use nearly all available RAM as cache if
      the default system settings are not changed. This may lead to a heavy
      fragmentation of the host memory preventing VirtualBox VMs from being
      started. We recommend to limit the ZFS cache by adding a line<screen>set zfs:zfs_arc_max = xxxx</screen>
      to /etc/system where <computeroutput>xxxx</computeroutput> bytes is the
      amount of memory usable for the ZFS cache.</para>

      <title>VM aborts with out of memory errors on Solaris 10 hosts</title>

      <para>32-bit Solaris 10 hosts (bug 1225025) require swap space equal to,
      or greater than the host's physical memory size. For example, 8 GB
      physical memory would require at least 8 GB swap. This can be configured
      during a Solaris 10 install by choosing a 'custom install' and changing
      the default partitions.</para>

      <note>
        <para>This restriction applies only to 32-bit Solaris hosts, 64-bit
        hosts are not affected!</para>
      </note>

      <para>For existing Solaris 10 installs, an additional swap image needs
      to be mounted and used as swap. Hence if you have 1 GB swap and 8 GB of
      physical memory, you require to add 7 GB more swap. This can be done as
      follows:</para>

      <para>For ZFS (as root user):</para>

      <para><screen>zfs create -V 8gb /_&lt;ZFS volume&gt;_/swap
swap -a /dev/zvol/dsk/_&lt;ZFS volume&gt;_/swap</screen></para>

      <para>To mount if after reboot, add the following line to
      /etc/vfstab:</para>

      <screen>/dev/zvol/dsk/_&lt;ZFS volume&gt;_/swap - - swap - no -</screen>

      <para>Alternatively, you could grow the existing swap using:</para>

      <screen>zfs set volsize=8G rpool/swap</screen>

      <para>And reboot the system for the changes to take effect.</para>

      <para>For UFS (as root user):</para>

      <screen>mkfile 7g /path/to/swapfile.img
swap -a /path/to/swapfile.img</screen>

      <para>To mount it after reboot, add the following line to
      /etc/vfstab:</para>

      <screen>/path/to/swap.img - - swap - no -</screen>
