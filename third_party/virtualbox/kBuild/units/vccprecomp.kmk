# Early target processing pass #1.

# This set the internal _VCC_PCH_FILE and VCC_COMMON_OBJ_PDB properties,
# which will be picked up by the VCCxxx tool.

#
# Early target processing pass #2.
#
# This sets up a rule for creating the .pch file after qt5 and similar units
# are done modifying INCS, DEFS and company.  The 'tool' variable is defined by
# footer-pass2-compiling-targets.kmk and is really the LD tool, but that'll
# have to do for now.  The '-PCH' variant of the VCC tool, is defined together
# with $(tool) and allow us to bypass the options and dependencies triggered
# by _1_VCC_PCH_FILE, _1_VCC_COMMON_OBJ_PDB and _PCH_HDR, and also make sure we
# don't get circular dependencies by way of kDepObj and the debug info.
