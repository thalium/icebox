# By default this is disabled meaning if the interface does not have Ipv6
# plumbed when the virtual machine starts, guest<->host Ipv6 will not work
# though guest<->remote Ipv6 would work.

# which you want vboxflt to adjust accordingly, otherwise keep this disabled.
# Enabling this option will have some minor performance penalty.
