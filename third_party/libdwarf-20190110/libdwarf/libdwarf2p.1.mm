This document describes an interface to a library of functions
to create DWARF debugging information entries and DWARF line number
information. It does not make recommendations as to how the functions
described in this document should be implemented nor does it
suggest possible optimizations.

The document is oriented to creating DWARF version 2.
Support for creating DWARF3 is intended but such support
is not yet fully present.
DWARF4 support is also intended.

.H 1 "INTRODUCTION"
This document describes an interface to \f(CWlibdwarf\fP, a
library of functions to provide creation of DWARF debugging information
records, DWARF line number information, DWARF address range and
pubnames information, weak names information, and DWARF frame description 
information.

WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

.H 2 "Purpose and Scope"
The purpose of this document is to propose a library of functions to 
create DWARF debugging information.
Reading (consuming) of such records 
is discussed in a separate document.

The functions in this document have mostly been implemented at 
Silicon Graphics
and used by the SGI code generator
to provide debugging information.
Some functions (and support for some extensions) were provided
by Sun Microsystems.

Example code showing one use of the functionality
may be found in the dwarfgen 
\f(CWdwarfgen\fP
and
\f(CWsimpleexample\fP
application
(provided in the source distribution along with libdwarf).

.P
The focus of this document is the functional interface,
and as such, implementation and optimization issues are
intentionally ignored.

.P
Error handling, error codes, and certain 
\f(CWLibdwarf\fP codes are discussed
in the "\fIA Consumer Library Interface to DWARF\fP",
which should 
be read before reading this document.
.P
Before December 2018 
very few functions in the Producer Library follow the error-returns
as defined in "\fIA Consumer Library Interface to DWARF\fP".
.P
As of December 2018 every Producer Library call has
a version that supports that Consumer Library Interface
and returns DW_DLV_OK or DW_DLV_ERROR (the Producer Library
has no use of DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY).
The table of contents of this document lists the latest
version of each function. However, all the earlier
documentation is present here immediately following
the documentation of the latest, and preferred, interface. 
All the earlier interfaces are supported in the library.
.P
Early interfaces (before December 2018)
The general style of functions here 
in the producer library is rather C-traditional
with various types as return values (quite different
from the consumer library interfaces).
The style
generally follows the style of the original DWARF1 reader
proposed as an interface to DWARF.
When the style of the reader interfaces was changed (1994) in the
dwarf reader ( See the "Document History"
section of "A Consumer Library Interface to DWARF")
the interfaces here were not changed as it seemed like
too much of a change for the two applications then using
the interface!  So this interface remains in the traditional C style
of returning various data types with various (somewhat inconsistent)
means of indicating failure.
.P
December 2018 and later function interfaces
all return either DW_DLV_OK or DW_DLV_ERROR
in a simple int.
.P
The error handling code in the library may either
return a value or abort. 
The library user can provide a function that the producer code
will call on errors (which would allow callers avoid testing
for error returns if the user function exits or aborts).
See the  \f(CWdwarf_producer_init()\fP
description below for more details.

.H 2 "Document History"
This document originally prominently referenced
"UNIX International Programming Languages Special Interest Group " 
(PLSIG).
Both  UNIX International and the
affiliated  Programming Languages Special Interest Group
are defunct
(UNIX is a registered trademark of UNIX System Laboratories, Inc.
in the United States and other countries).
Nothing except the general interface style is actually
related to anything shown to the PLSIG
(this document was open sourced with libdwarf in the mid 1990's).
.P
See "http://www.dwarfstd.org" for information on current
DWARF standards and committee activities.

.H 2 "Definitions"
DWARF debugging information entries (DIEs) are the segments of information 
placed in the \f(CW.debug_info\fP  and related
sections by compilers, assemblers, and linkage 
editors that, in conjunction with line number entries, are necessary for 
symbolic source-level debugging.  
Refer to the document 
"\fIDWARF Debugging Information Format\fP" from UI PLSIG for a more complete 
description of these entries.

.P
This document adopts all the terms and definitions in
"\fIDWARF Debugging Information Format\fP" version 2.
and the "\fIA Consumer Library Interface to DWARF\fP".

.P
In addition, this document refers to Elf, the ATT/USL System V
Release 4 object format.
This is because the library was first developed for that object
format.
Hopefully the functions defined here can easily be
applied to other object formats.

.H 2 "Overview"
The remaining sections of this document describe a proposed producer 
(compiler or assembler) interface to \fILibdwarf\fP, first by describing 
the purpose of additional types defined by the interface, followed by 
descriptions of the available operations.  
This document assumes you 
are thoroughly familiar with the information contained in the 
\fIDWARF 
Debugging Information Format\fP document, and 
"\fIA Consumer Library Interface to DWARF\fP".

.P
The interface necessarily knows a little bit about the object format
(which is assumed to be Elf).  We make an attempt to make this knowledge 
as limited as possible.  For example, \fILibdwarf\fP does not do the 
writing of object data to the disk.  The producer program does that.

.H 2 "Revision History"
.VL 15
.LI "March 1993"
Work on dwarf2 sgi producer draft begins
.LI "March 1999"
Adding a function to allow any number of trips
through the dwarf_get_section_bytes() call.
.LI "April 10 1999"
Added support for assembler text output of dwarf
(as when the output must pass through an assembler).
Revamped internals for better performance and
simpler provision for differences in ABI.
.LI "Sep 1, 1999"
Added support for little- and cross- endian
debug info creation.
.LI "May 7  2007"
This library interface now cleans up, deallocating
all memory it uses (the application simply calls
dwarf_producer_finish(dbg)).
.LI "September 20  2010"
Now documents the marker feature of DIE creation.
.LI "May 01  2014"
The dwarf_producer_init() code has a new interface
and DWARF is configured at run time by its arguments.
The producer code used to be configured at configure
time, but the configure time producer configure options
are no longer used. 
The configuration was unnecessarily complicated:
the run-time configuration is simpler to understand.
.LI "September 10, 2016"
Beginning the process of creating new interfaces
so that checking for error is consistent across all
calls (as is done in the consumer library).
The old interfaces are kept and supported so
we have binary and source compatibility with
old code.
.LI "December 01, 2018"
All function interfaces now have a version
that returns only DW_DLV_OK or DW_DLV_ERROR
and pointer and other values are returned
through pointer arguments.
For example, dwarf_add_frame_info_c()
is the December 2018 version, while
dwarf_add_frame_info(), 
dwarf_add_frame_info_b()
are earlier versions (which are still supported).
.LE

.H 1 "Type Definitions"

.H 2 "General Description"
The \fIlibdwarf.h\fP 
header file contains typedefs and preprocessor 
definitions of types and symbolic names 
used to reference objects of \fI Libdwarf \fP .  
The types defined by typedefs contained in \fI libdwarf.h\fP 
all use the convention of adding \fI Dwarf_ \fP 
as a prefix to
indicate that they refer to objects used by Libdwarf.  
The prefix \fI Dwarf_P_\fP is used for objects 
referenced by the \fI Libdwarf\fP 
Producer when there are similar but distinct 
objects used by the Consumer.

.H 2 "Namespace issues"
Application programs should avoid creating names
beginning with 
\f(CWDwarf_\fP
\f(CWdwarf_\fP
or 
\f(CWDW_\fP
as these are reserved to dwarf and libdwarf.

.H 1 "libdwarf and Elf and relocations"
Much of the description below presumes that 
Elf is the object
format in use.
The library is probably usable with other object formats
that allow arbitrary sections to be created.
The library does not write anything to disk.
Instead it provides access so that callers
can do that.


.H 2 "binary or assembler output"
With 
\f(CWDW_DLC_STREAM_RELOCATIONS\fP 
(see below)
it is assumed that the calling app will simply
write the streams and relocations directly into
an Elf file, without going through an assembler.

With 
\f(CWDW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS\fP 
the calling app must either 
A) generate binary relocation streams and write
the generated debug information streams and
the relocation streams direct to an elf file
or
B) generate assembler output text for an assembler
to read and produce an object file. 

With case B) the libdwarf-calling application must
use the relocation information to change
points of each binary stream into references to 
symbolic names.  
It is necessary for the assembler to be
willing to accept and generate relocations
for references from arbitrary byte boundaries.
For example:
.sp
.nf
.in +4
 .data 0a0bcc    #producing 3 bytes of data.
 .word mylabel   #producing a reference
 .word endlabel - startlabel #producing absolute length
.in -4
.fi
.sp




.H 2 "libdwarf relationship to Elf"
When the documentation below refers to 'an elf section number'
it is really only dependent on getting (via the callback
function passed by the caller of
\f(CWdwarf_producer_init()\fP.
a sequence of integers back (with 1 as the lowest).

When the documentation below refers to 'an Elf symbol index'
it is really dependent on 
Elf symbol numbers
only if
\f(CWDW_DLC_STREAM_RELOCATIONS\fP 
are being generated (see below).
With 
\f(CWDW_DLC_STREAM_RELOCATIONS\fP 
the library is generating Elf relocations
and the section numbers in binary form so
the section numbers and symbol indices must really 
be Elf (or elf-like) numbers.


With
\f(CWDW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS\fP 
the values passed as symbol indexes can be any
integer set or even pointer set.
All that libdwarf assumes is that where values
are unique they get unique values.
Libdwarf does not generate any kind of symbol table
from the numbers and does not check their
uniqueness or lack thereof.

.H 2 "libdwarf and relocations"
With
\f(CWDW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS\fP 
libdwarf creates binary streams of debug information
and arrays of relocation information describing
the necessary relocation.
The Elf section numbers and symbol numbers appear
nowhere in the binary streams. Such appear
only in the relocation information and the passed-back
information from calls requesting the relocation information.
As a consequence, the 'symbol indices' can be
any pointer or integer value as the caller must
arrange that the output deal with relocations.

With 
\f(CWDW_DLC_STREAM_RELOCATIONS\fP 
all the relocations are directly created by libdwarf
as binary streams (libdwarf only creates the streams
in memory,
it does not write them to disk).

.H 2 "symbols, addresses, and offsets"
The following applies to calls that
pass in symbol indices, addresses, and offsets, such
as
\f(CWdwarf_add_AT_targ_address_c() \fP 
\f(CWdwarf_add_arange_b()\fP 
and
\f(CWdwarf_add_frame_fde_c()\fP.

With 
\f(CWDW_DLC_STREAM_RELOCATIONS\fP 
a passed in address is one of:
a) a section offset and the (non-global) symbol index of
a section symbol.
b) A symbol index (global symbol) and a zero offset.

With \f(CWDW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS\fP
the same approach can be used, or, instead,
a passed in address may be
c) a symbol handle and an offset.
In this case, since it is up to the calling app to
generate binary relocations (if appropriate)
or to turn the binary stream into 
a text stream (for input to an assembler, if appropriate)
the application has complete control of the interpretation
of the symbol handles.

.H 1 "Memory Management"

Several of the functions that comprise the \fILibdwarf\fP 
producer interface dynamically allocate values and some
return pointers to those spaces.
The dynamically allocated spaces 
can not be reclaimed  (and must
not be freed) except that
all such libdwarf-allocated memory
is freed by 
\f(CWdwarf_producer_finish_a(dbg)\fP  
or
\f(CWdwarf_producer_finish(dbg)\fP.  

All data for a particular \f(CWDwarf_P_Debug\fP descriptor
is separate from the data for any other 
\f(CWDwarf_P_Debug\fP descriptor in use in the library-calling
application.

.H 2 "Read Only Properties"
The read-only properties
specified in the
consumer interface document do not
generally apply to the functions
described here.

.H 2 "Storage Deallocation"
Calling \f(CWdwarf_producer_finish_a(dbg)\fP frees all the space, and 
invalidates all pointers returned from \f(CWLibdwarf\fP functions on 
or descended from \f(CWdbg\fP).

.H 2 "Error Handling"
In general any error detected by the producer
should be considered fatal. 
That is, it is impossible to produce correct
output so producing anything seems questionable.
.P
The original producer interfaces tended to return
a pointer or a large integer as a result and
required the caller to cast that value to determine
if it was actually a -1 meaning there was an error.
.P
Beginning in September 2016 additional interfaces
are being added to eliminate the necessity for callers
to do this ugly casting of results.
In December 2018 that process has reached completion.
The revised functions return
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP,
or
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP.
(which are small signed integers) and will
have an additional pointer argument that will provide
the value that used to be the return value.
This will make the interfaces type-safe.
.P
The function
\f(CWdwarf_get_section_bytes_a()\fP
can also return
\f(CWDW_DLV_NO_ENTRY\fP.
.P
The original interfaces will remain.
Binary and source compatibility for old
code using the older interfaces is retained.

.H 1 "Functional Interface"
This section describes the functions available in the \fILibdwarf\fP
library.  Each function description includes its definition, followed 
by a paragraph describing the function's operation.
.P
The following sections describe these functions.
.P
The functions may be categorized into groups: 
\fIinitialization and termination operations\fP,
\fIdebugging information entry creation\fP,
\fIElf section callback function\fP,
\fIattribute creation\fP,
\fIexpression creation\fP, 
\fIline number creation\fP, 
\fIfast-access (aranges) creation\fP, 
\fIfast-access (pubnames) creation\fP, 
\fIfast-access (weak names) creation\fP,
\fImacro information creation\fP, 
\fIlow level (.debug_frame) creation\fP, 
and
\fIlocation list (.debug_loc) creation\fP. 
.P
.H 2 "Initialization and Termination Operations"
These functions setup \f(CWLibdwarf\fP to accumulate debugging information
for an object, usually a compilation-unit, provided by the producer.
The actual addition of information is done by functions in the other
sections of this document.  Once all the information has been added,
functions from this section are used to transform the information to
appropriate byte streams, and help to write out the byte streams to
disk.

Typically then, a producer application 
would create a \f(CWDwarf_P_Debug\fP 
descriptor to gather debugging information for a particular
compilation-unit using \f(CWdwarf_producer_init()\fP.  

The producer application would 
use this \f(CWDwarf_P_Debug\fP descriptor to accumulate debugging 
information for this object using functions from other sections of 
this document.  
Once all the information had been added, it would 
call \f(CWdwarf_transform_to_disk_form()\fP to convert the accumulated 
information into byte streams in accordance with the \f(CWDWARF\fP 
standard.  
The application would then repeatedly call 
\f(CWdwarf_get_section_bytes_a()\fP 
for each of the \f(CW.debug_*\fP created.  
This gives the producer 
information about the data bytes to be written to disk.  
At this point, 
the producer would release all resource used by \f(CWLibdwarf\fP for 
this object by calling \f(CWdwarf_producer_finish_a()\fP.

It is also possible to create assembler-input character streams
from the byte streams created by this library.
This feature requires slightly different interfaces than
direct binary output.
The details are mentioned in the text.

.H 3 "dwarf_producer_init()"

.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_producer_init(
        Dwarf_Unsigned flags,
        Dwarf_Callback_Func func,
        Dwarf_Handler errhand,
        Dwarf_Ptr errarg,
        void *    user_data      
        const char *isa_name,
        const char *dwarf_version,
        const char *extra, 
        Dwarf_P_Debug *dbg_returned,
        Dwarf_Error *error) \fP
.DE
.P
The function \f(CWdwarf_producer_init() \fP returns a new 
\f(CWDwarf_P_Debug\fP descriptor that can be used to add
\f(CWDwarf\fP 
information to the object.  
On success it returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP.  
On error it returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP.  
\f(CWflags\fP determine whether the target object is 64-bit or 32-bit.  
\f(CWfunc\fP
is a pointer to a function called-back from \f(CWLibdwarf\fP 
whenever \f(CWLibdwarf\fP needs to create a new object section (as it will 
for each .debug_* section and related relocation section).  

.P
The \f(CWflags\fP
values (to be OR'd together in the flags field
in the calling code) are as follows:
.in +4
\f(CWDW_DLC_WRITE\fP 
is required.
The values
\f(CWDW_DLC_READ\fP  
\f(CWDW_DLC_RDWR\fP
are not supported by the producer and must not be passed.

The flag bit
\f(CWDW_DLC_POINTER64\fP
(or
\f(CWDW_DLC_SIZE_64\fP)
Indicates the target has a 64 bit (8 byte) address size.
The flag bit
\f(CWDW_DLC_POINTER32\fP
(or
\f(CWDW_DLC_SIZE_32\fP)
Indicates the target has a 32 bit (4 byte) address size.
If none of these pointer sizes is passed in 
\f(CWDW_DLC_POINTER32\fP 
is assumed.

The flag bit
\f(CWDW_DLC_OFFSET32\fP
indicates that 32bit offsets should be used in the generated DWARF.
The flag bit
\f(CWDW_DLC_OFFSET64\fP
\f(CWDW_DLC_OFFSET_SIZE_64\fP
indicates that 64bit offsets should be used in the generated DWARF.

The flag bit
\f(CWDW_DLC_IRIX_OFFSET64\fP
indicates that the generated DWARF should use the
early (pre DWARF3) IRIX method of generating 64 bit offsets.
In this case \f(CWDW_DLC_POINTER64\fP should also be passed in,
and the \f(CWisa_name\fP
passed in (see below) should be "irix".



If
\f(CWDW_DLC_TARGET_BIGENDIAN\fP
or
\f(CWDW_DLC_TARGET_LITTLEENDIAN\fP
is not ORed into \f(CWflags\fP
then 
endianness the same as the host is assumed.
If both 
\f(CWDW_DLC_TARGET_LITTLEENDIAN\fP
and
\f(CWDW_DLC_TARGET_BIGENDIAN\fP
are OR-d in it is an error.



Either one of two output forms is specifiable:
\f(CWDW_DLC_STREAM_RELOCATIONS\fP 
or
\f(CWDW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS\fP .

The default is
\f(CWDW_DLC_STREAM_RELOCATIONS\fP . 
The
\f(CWDW_DLC_STREAM_RELOCATIONS\fP
are relocations in a binary stream (as used
in a MIPS/IRIX Elf object).

The
\f(CWDW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS\fP
are the same relocations but expressed in an
array of structures defined by libdwarf,
which the caller of the relevant function
(see below) must deal with appropriately.
This method of expressing relocations allows 
the producer-application to easily produce
assembler text output of debugging information.

When
\f(CWDW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS\fP
is ORed into \f(CWflags\fP
then relocations are returned not as streams
but through an array of structures.

.in -4

.P
The function 
\f(CWfunc\fP 
must be provided by the user of this library.
Its prototype is:
.DS
\f(CWtypedef int (*Dwarf_Callback_Func)(
    char* name,
    int                 size,
    Dwarf_Unsigned      type,
    Dwarf_Unsigned      flags,
    Dwarf_Unsigned      link,
    Dwarf_Unsigned      info,
    Dwarf_Unsigned*     sect_name_index,
    void *              user_data,
    int*                error) \fP
.DE
For each section in the object file that \f(CWlibdwarf\fP
needs to create, it calls this function once (calling it
from \f(CWdwarf_transform_to_disk_form()\fP), passing in
the section \f(CWname\fP, the section \f(CWtype\fP,
the section \f(CWflags\fP, the \f(CWlink\fP field, and
the \f(CWinfo\fP field.  
For an Elf object file these values
should be appropriate Elf section header values.
For example, for relocation callbacks, the \f(CWlink\fP
field is supposed to be set (by the app) to the index
of the symtab section (the link field passed through the
callback must be ignored by the app).
And, for relocation callbacks, the \f(CWinfo\fP field
is passed as the elf section number of the section
the relocations apply to.
.P
The  \f(CWsect_name_index\fP field is a field you use
to pass a symbol index back to libdwarf.
In Elf, each section gets an elf symbol table entry
so that relocations have an address to refer to
(relocations rely on addresses in the Elf symbol table).
You will create the Elf symbol table, so you have to tell
libdwarf the index to put into relocation records for the
section newly defined here.
.P
On success
the user function should return the Elf section number of the
newly created Elf section.
.P
On success, the function should also set the integer
pointed to by \f(CWsect_name_index\fP to the
Elf symbol number assigned in the Elf symbol table of the
new Elf section.
This symbol number is needed with relocations
dependent on the relocation of this new section.
.P
Use the 
\f(CWdwarf_producer_init_c()\fP
interface instead of this interface.
.P
For example, the \f(CW.debug_line\fP section's third
data element (in a compilation unit) is the offset from the
beginning of the \f(CW.debug_info\fP section of the compilation
unit entry for this \f(CW.debug_line\fP set.
The relocation entry in \f(CW.rel.debug_line\fP
for this offset
must have the relocation symbol index of the 
symbol \f(CW.debug_info\fP  returned
by the callback of that section-creation through 
the pointer \f(CWsect_name_index\fP.
.P
On failure, the function should return -1 and set the \f(CWerror\fP
integer to an error code.
.P
Nothing in libdwarf actually depends on the section index
returned being a real Elf section.
The Elf section is simply useful for generating relocation
records.
Similarly, the Elf symbol table index returned through 
the \f(CWsect_name_index\fP must be an index
that can be used in relocations against this section.
The application will probably want to note the
values passed to this function in some form, even if
no Elf file is being produced.

.P
\f(CWerrhand\fP 
is a pointer to a function that will be used as
a default fall-back function for handling errors detected 
by \f(CWLibdwarf\fP.  

.P
\f(CWerrarg\fP is the default error argument used 
by the function pointed to by \f(CWerrhand\fP.
.P
For historical reasons the error handling is complicated
and the following three paragraphs describe the three
possible scenarios when a producer function detects an error.
In all cases a short error message is printed on
stdout if the error number
is negative (as all such should be, see libdwarf.h).
Then further action is taken as follows.
.P
First,
if the  Dwarf_Error argument to any specific producer function
(see the functions documented below)  is non-null
the \f(CWerrhand\fP argument here is ignored in that call and
the specific producer function sets the Dwarf_Error and returns
some specific value (for dwarf_producer_init it is DW_DLV_OK
as mentioned just above) indicating there is an error.
.P
Second,
if the  Dwarf_Error argument to any specific producer function 
(see the functions documented below)  is NULL and the
\f(CWerrarg\fP
to \f(CWdwarf_producer_init()\fP is non-NULL
then on an error in the producer code the Dwarf_Handler function is called
and if that called function returns the producer code returns
a specific value (for dwarf_producer_init it is DW_DLV_OK
as mentioned just above) indicating there is an error.
.P
Third,
if the  Dwarf_Error argument to any specific producer function
(see the functions documented below)  is NULL and the

to \f(CWdwarf_producer_init()\fP is NULL
then on an error \f(CWabort()\fP is called.

.P
The \f(CWuser_data\fP argument is not examined by libdwarf.
It is passed to user code in all 
calls by libdwarf to  the \f(CWDwarf_Callback_Func()\fP
function and 
may be used by consumer code for the consumer's own purposes.
Typical uses might be to pass in a pointer to some user
data structure or to pass an integer that somehow
is useful to the libdwarf-using code.

.P
The \f(CWisa_name\fP argument 
must be non-null and contain one of the
strings defined in the isa_relocs array
in pro_init.c: "irix","mips","x86",
"x86_64","arm","arm64","ppc","ppc64",
"sparc". 
The names are not strictly ISA
names (nor ABI names) but a hopefully-meaningful
mixing of the concepts of ISA and ABI.
The intent is mainly to 
define relocation codes applicable to DW_DLC_STREAM_RELOCATIONS.
New \f(CWisa_name\fP values will be provided as users
request. In the "irix" case a special relocation is defined
so a special CIE reference field can be created (if and
only if the augmentation
string is "z").
.P
The \f(CWdwarf_version\fP argument 
should be one of 
"V2",
"V3",
"V4",
"V5"
to indicate which DWARF version is the overall format
to be emitted.  Individual section version numbers will obey
the standard for that overall DWARF version.
Initially only "V2" is supported.
.P
The \f(CWextra\fP argument 
is intended to support a comma-separated
list of as-yet-undefined options.
Passing in a null pointer or an empty string
is acceptable if no such options are needed 
or used.  All-lowercase option names are reserved to
the libdwarf implementation itself (specific implementations
may want to use a leading upper-case letter for
additional options).

.P
The \f(CWerror\fP argument 
is set through the pointer to return specific error  
if \f(CWerror\fP is non-null and
and there is an error.  The error details
will be passed back through this pointer argument.

New September 2016.
The function
\f(CWdwarf_transform_to_disk_form_a()\fP 
is new in September 2016. 
It produces the same result as
\f(CWdwarf_transform_to_disk_form()\fP 
but returns the count through the new

\f(CWchunk_count_out\fP . 
.P
On success it returns

\f(CWchunk_count_out\fP 
to
the number of chunks of section data to be
accessed by
\f(CWdwarf_get_section_bytes_a()\fP .
.P
It
turns the DIE and other information specified
for this \f(CWDwarf_P_Debug\fP into a stream of
bytes for each section being produced.
These byte streams can be retrieved from
the \f(CWDwarf_P_Debug\fP by calls to
\f(CWdwarf_get_section_bytes_a()\fP (see below).
.P
In case of error
\f(CWdwarf_transform_to_disk_form_a()\fP 
returns
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP.
.P
The number of chunks
is used to access data 
by
\f(CWdwarf_get_section_bytes_a()\fP
(see below) and the section data
provided your code will insert
into an object file or the like.
Each section of the resulting object is typically
many small chunks. 
Each chunk has a section index
and a length as well as a pointer to a block of data
(see
\f(CWdwarf_get_section_bytes_a()\fP
).
.P
For each unique section being produced 
\f(CWdwarf_transform_to_disk_form_a()\fP 
calls the
\f(CWDwarf_Callback_Func\fP exactly once. 
The callback provides the connection
between Elf sections (which we presume
is the object format to be emitted) and
the 
\f(CWlibdwarf()\fP 
internal section numbering.
.P
For \f(CWDW_DLC_STREAM_RELOCATIONS\fP
a call to 
\f(CWDwarf_Callback_Func\fP is made
by libdwarf for each relocation section.
Calls to \f(CWdwarf_get_section_bytes_a()\fP (see below).
allow the 
\f(CWdwarf_transform_to_disk_form_a()\fP  caller
to get byte streams and write them to
an object file as desired, just as with
the other sections of the object being created.
.P
For \f(CWDW_DLC_SYMBOLIC_RELOCATIONS\fP
the user code should use
\f(CWdwarf_get_relocation_info_count()\fP
and
\f(CWdwarf_get_relocation_info()\fP
to retrieve the relocation info
generated by 
\f(CWdwarf_transform_to_disk_form()\fP
and do something with it.

On failure it returns 
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP

.P
In case of an error, 
\f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP

There is no requirement that the section bytes actually 
be written to an elf file.
For example, consider the .debug_info section and its
relocation section (the call back function would resulted in
assigning 'section' numbers and the link field to tie these
together (.rel.debug_info would have a link to .debug_info).
One could examine the relocations, split the .debug_info
data at relocation boundaries, emit byte streams (in hex)
as assembler output, and at each relocation point,
emit an assembler directive with a symbol name for the assembler.
Examining the relocations is awkward though.

The \f(CWerror\fP argument is not set.

It returns DW_DLV_NO_ENTRY if there are no entries

The \f(CWerror\fP argument is not set.

It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP if there is an error.
Calling \f(CWdwarf_get_relocation_info() \fP
more than the number of times indicated by
\f(CWdwarf_get_relocation_info_count() \fP
(without an intervening call to
\f(CWdwarf_reset_section_bytes() \fP )
results in a return of \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP once past
the valid count.
The \f(CWerror\fP argument is set to indicate the error.

Now consider the returned-through-pointer values for
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP .

\f(CW*elf_section_index\fP
is the 'elf section index' of the section implied by
this group of relocations.


\f(CW*elf_section_index_link\fP
is the section index of the section that these
relocations apply to.

\f(CW*relocation_buffer_count\fP
is the number of array entries of relocation information
in the array pointed to by
\f(CW*reldata_buffer\fP .


\f(CW*reldata_buffer\fP
points to an array of 'struct Dwarf_Relocation_Data_s'
structures.

The version 2 array information is as follows:

.nf
enum Dwarf_Rel_Type {dwarf_drt_none,
                dwarf_drt_data_reloc,
                dwarf_drt_segment_rel,
                dwarf_drt_first_of_length_pair,
                dwarf_drt_second_of_length_pair
};
typedef struct Dwarf_Relocation_Data_s  * Dwarf_Relocation_Data;
struct Dwarf_Relocation_Data_s {
        unsigned char        drd_type;   /* contains Dwarf_Rel_Type */
	unsigned char        drd_length; /* typically 4 or 8 */
        Dwarf_Unsigned       drd_offset; /* where the data to reloc is */
        Dwarf_Unsigned       drd_symbol_index;
};

.fi

The \f(CWDwarf_Rel_Type\fP enum is encoded (via casts if necessary)
into the single unsigned char \f(CWdrd_type\fP field to control
the space used for this information (keep the space to 1 byte).

The unsigned char \f(CWdrd_length\fP field
holds the size in bytes of the field to be relocated.
So for elf32 object formats with 32 bit apps, \f(CWdrd_length\fP
will be 4.  For objects with MIPS -64 contents,
\f(CWdrd_length\fP will be 8.  
For some dwarf 64 bit environments, such as ia64, \f(CWdrd_length\fP
is 4 for some relocations (file offsets, for example) 
and 8 for others (run time
addresses, for example).

If \f(CWdrd_type\fP is \f(CWdwarf_drt_none\fP, this is an unused slot
and it should be ignored.

If \f(CWdrd_type\fP is \f(CWdwarf_drt_data_reloc\fP 
this is an ordinary relocation.
The relocation type means either
(R_MIPS_64) or (R_MIPS_32) (or the like for
the particular ABI.
\f(CWdrd_length\fP gives the length of the field to be relocated.
\f(CWdrd_offset\fP
is an offset (of the
value to be relocated) in
the section this relocation stuff is linked to.
\f(CWdrd_symbol_index\fP
is the symbol index (if elf symbol
indices were provided) or the handle to arbitrary
information (if that is what the caller passed in 
to the relocation-creating dwarf calls) of the symbol
that the relocation is relative to.


When \f(CWdrd_type\fP is \f(CWdwarf_drt_first_of_length_pair\fP
the next data record will be \f(CWdrt_second_of_length_pair\fP
and the \f(CWdrd_offset\fP of the two data records will match.
The relevant 'offset' in the section this reloc applies to
should contain a symbolic pair like
.nf
.in +4
 .word    second_symbol - first_symbol
.in -4
.fi
to generate a length.
\f(CWdrd_length\fP gives the length of the field to be relocated.

\f(CWdrt_segment_rel\fP
means (R_MIPS_SCN_DISP)
is the real relocation (R_MIPS_SCN_DISP applies to
exception tables and this part may need further work).
\f(CWdrd_length\fP gives the length of the field to be relocated.

.P
The memory space of the section byte stream is freed

the newer function is simpler to

.H 2 "DIE Markers"
DIE markers provide a way for a producer to extract DIE offsets
from DIE generation.  The markers do not influence the
generation of DWARF, they simply allow a producer to
extract .debug_info offsets for whatever purpose the
producer finds useful (for example, a producer might
want some unique other section unknown
to libdwarf to know a particular DIE offset).

One marks one or more DIEs as desired any time before
calling \f(CWdwarf_transform_to_disk_form()\fP.

After calling \f(CWdwarf_transform_to_disk_form()\fP
call 
\f(CWdwarf_get_die_markers()\fP 
which has the offsets where the marked DIEs were written
in the generated .debug_info data.

The call is only meaningful after 
a call to \f(CWdwarf_transform_to_disk_form()\fP as the
transform call creates the \f(CWstruct Dwarf_P_Marker_s\fP
structures, one for each DIE generated for .debug_info
(but only for DIEs that had a non-zero marker value).
The field \f(CWma_offset\fP in the structure is set
during generation of the .debug_info byte stream.
The field \f(CWma_marker\fP in the structure is a copy
of the DIE marker of the DIE given that offset.

It returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP, on success.

The field \f(CWma_marker\fP in the structure is a copy
of the DIE marker of the DIE given that offset.

It returns \f(CW0\fP, on success.
On error it returns \f(CWDW_DLV_BADADDR\fP (if there are no
markers it returns \f(CWDW_DLV_BADADDR\fP).

.H 2 "Attribute Creation"
The functions in this section add attributes to a \f(CWDIE\fP.
These functions return a \f(CWDwarf_P_Attribute\fP descriptor 
that represents the attribute added to the given \f(CWDIE\fP.  
In most cases the return value is only useful to determine if 
an error occurred.

Some of the attributes have values that are relocatable.  
They
need a symbol with respect to which the linker will perform
relocation.  
This symbol is specified by means of an index into
the Elf symbol table for the object
(of course, the symbol index can be more general than an index).

to the reference target DIE.
This must be done before transforming to disk form.
\f(CWattrnum()\fP should be the 
attribute number of the attribute of \fCWownerdie\fP which is
to be updated.
For example, if a local forward reference
was in a \fCWDW_AT_sibling\fP attribute in ownerdie, pass
the value \fCWDW_AT_sibling\fP as attrnum.
.P
Since no attribute number can appear more than once on a

the

attribute of \fCWownerdie\fP to update
.P
It returns either \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP (on success)

.H 2 "Line Number Operations"
These are operations on the .debug_line section.  
They provide 
information about instructions in the program and the source 
lines the instruction come from.  
Typically, code is generated

blocks.  
To make the provision of relocation information more 
efficient, the information is recorded in such a manner that only
the address of the start of the block needs to be relocated.  
This is done by providing the address of the first instruction 
in a block using the function \f(CWdwarf_lne_set_address()\fP.  
Information about the instructions in the block are then added 
using the function \f(CWdwarf_add_line_entry()\fP, which specifies
offsets from the address of the first instruction.  
The end of 
a contiguous block is indicated by calling the function

.DE
The function 
\f(CWdwarf_lne_set_address_a()\fP sets the target address
at which a contiguous block of instructions begin.
Information about
the instructions in the block is added to .debug_line using calls to
\f(CWdwarfdwarf_add_line_entry_c()\fP
which specifies the offset of each
instruction in the block relative to the start of the block.  
This is
done so that a single relocation record can be used to obtain the final
target address of every instruction in the block.

The relocatable address of the start of the block of instructions is
specified by 
\f(CWoffs\fP.
The symbol used to relocate the address
is given by 
\f(CWsymidx\fP, which is normally the index of the symbol in the
Elf symbol table.

It returns 
\f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP on success, and

\f(CW0\fP on error.

.H 2 "Macro Information Creation"
All strings passed in by the caller are copied by these
functions, so the space in which the caller provides the strings
may be ephemeral (on the stack, or immediately reused or whatever)
without this causing any difficulty.

.H 3 "dwarf_def_macro()"
.DS
\f(CWint dwarf_def_macro(Dwarf_P_Debug dbg,
	Dwarf_Unsigned lineno,
	char *name
	char *value,
        Dwarf_Error *error);\fP
.DE
Adds a macro definition.
The \f(CWname\fP argument should include the parentheses
and parameter names if this is a function-like macro.
Neither string should contain extraneous whitespace.
\f(CWdwarf_def_macro()\fP adds the mandated space after the
name and before the value  in the
output DWARF section(but does not change the
strings pointed to by the arguments).
If this is a definition before any files are read,
\f(CWlineno\fP should be 0.
Returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP
and sets \f(CWerror\fP
if there is an error.
Returns \f(CWDW_DLV_OK\fP if the call was successful.


.H 3 "dwarf_undef_macro()"

\f(CWfileindex\fP is an index in the .debug_line header: 
the index of
the file name.
See the function \f(CWdwarf_add_file_decl()\fP.
The \f(CWlineno\fP should be 0 if this file is
the file of the compilation unit source itself

.DE
The meaning of the \f(CWconstant\fP and the\f(CWstring\fP
in the macro info section
are undefined by DWARF itself, but the string must be
an ordinary null terminated string.
This call is not an extension to DWARF. 
It simply enables storing
macro information as specified in the DWARF document.
Returns \f(CWDW_DLV_ERROR\fP

The function 
\f(CWdwarf_add_frame_info()\fP
adds the \f(CWFDE\fP
specified by \f(CWfde\fP to the list of \f(CWFDE\fPs for the
object represented by the given \f(CWdbg\fP.  

\f(CWdie\fP specifies
the \f(CWDIE\fP that represents the function whose frame information
is specified by the given \f(CWfde\fP.  
If the MIPS/IRIX specific DW_AT_MIPS_fde attribute is not
needed in .debug_info pass in 0 as the \f(CWdie\fP argument.

\f(CWcie\fP specifies the
index of the \f(CWCIE\fP that should be used to setup the initial
conditions for the given frame.  \f(CWvirt_addr\fP represents the
relocatable address at which the code for the given function begins,
and \f(CWsym_idx\fP gives the index of the relocatable symbol to
be used to relocate this address (\f(CWvirt_addr\fP that is).
\f(CWcode_len\fP specifies the size in bytes of the machine instructions
for the given function. 

\f(CWoffset_into_exception_tables\fP specifies the
offset into \f(CW.MIPS.eh_region\fP elf section where the exception tables 
for this function begins. 
\f(CWexception_table_symbol\fP  gives the index of 
the relocatable symbol to be used to relocate this offset.
These arguments are MIPS/IRIX specific, pass in 0 for
other targets.

On success
it returns an index to the given \f(CWfde\fP.

On failure it returns DW_DLV_NOCOUNT.
