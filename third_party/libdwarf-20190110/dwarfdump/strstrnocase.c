/*
This tries to find the string 'contained' in the
string 'container'.  it returns true if found, else false.
The comparisons are independent  of case.

Regrettably there is no generally accepted version that
does this job, though GNU Linux has  strcasestr() which
does what we need.   Our code here do not behave like
strstr or strcasestr in the case of
an empty 'contained' argument: we return FALSE (this
case is not interesting for dwarfdump).

There is a public domain stristr().    But given that dwarfdump is GPL,
it would seem (IANAL) that we cannot mix public domain code
into the release.

The software here is independently written and indeed trivial.

The POSIX function tolower() is only properly defined on unsigned char, hence
the ugly casts.
