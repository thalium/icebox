I would prefer you try using ../dwarfdump2, not this source.
If you  must use this for some reason, could you let me know why?
Thanks.

To build dwarfdump, first build libdwarf in the neighboring
directory then type
	./configure
	make

Installation is a bit primitive.
      sudo make install
may or may not work.   
Some or all of the following might be required on Unix or Linux or MacOS:
      sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/share/man/man1/
      sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/lib
      sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
Then retry the 'sudo make install' and (if necessary) try
      sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/dwarfdump
      sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/share/man/man1/dwarfdump.1
      sudo chmod a+r /usr/local/lib/dwarfdump.conf
You don't really need the dwarfdump.1 man page,
but you might as well have it. If the man page is not visible
with 'man dwarfdump' try  'man manpath' for hints.

If you don't need others using dwarfdump on your computer,
just 
    cp dwarfdump $HOME/bin/dwarfdump 
(by convention many people put personal executables in $HOME/bin
and fix up $PATH to refer there) which suffices as 'installation'.
Also   
    cp dwarfdump.conf $HOME 

To use dwarf or libdwarf, you may want to install dwarf.h
and libdwarf.h somewhere convenient.
You can just copy those two headers to /usr/local/include by hand
(or anywhere, really, that you have permission to copy to)
(you may need to use -I/usr/local/include on compile lines
to reference them there, but see below on configure and make).

Notice that dwarf_names.c and dwarf_names.h are supplied by
the release though the Makefile can and may rebuild them.
Some users find it difficult to get a reliable awk(1) program,
so for them these prebuilt versions may be useful.

If your headers or libelf/libdwarf are not in the expected places,
use the make command line to add flags and include directories.
For example
  ./configure
  PREINCS="-I /usr/local/include" POSTINCS="-I /home/x/include"  make
PREINCS content is inserted before CFLAGS as make(1) is running.
POSTINCS content is added after the CFLAGS value.

To set LDFLAGS,
do so at configure time, for example:
  ./configure LDFLAGS="-L /some/dir"
And/or use PRELIBS and/or POSTLIBS at 'make' time similar to the use
of PREINCS and POSTINCS.

If the libdwarf directory
has both libdwarf.so and libdwarf.a, the libdwarf.so
will be picked up and
  "./tag_tree_build: error while loading shared libraries:
        libdwarf.so: cannot open shared object file:  
        No such file or directory"
will probably result.
Either: remove libdwarf.so  and rebuild or set
the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH to  the directory 
containing the .so or use LDFLAGS to set rpath (see just below).   
It is perhaps simpler to ensure that the libdwarf directory
only has an archive, not  a shared-library.
But sometimes one wants a shared library.
In that case
one can set ld's -rpath on the gcc command line like this:
    LDFLAGS="-Wl,-rpath=/some/path/libdir"
so the shared library can be found at run time automatically.

The same problem may arise with libelf, and the same approach
will solve the problem.
