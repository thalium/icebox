NAME
       biosdecode - BIOS information decoder

SYNOPSIS
       biosdecode [OPTIONS]


DESCRIPTION
       biosdecode parses the BIOS memory and prints information
       about all structures (or entry points) it knows of. Cur-
       rently known entry point types are:

        SMBIOS (System Management BIOS)
         Use dmidecode for a more detailed output.

        DMI (Desktop Management Interface, a legacy version of
         SMBIOS)
         Use dmidecode for a more detailed output.

        SYSID

        PNP (Plug and Play)

        ACPI (Advanced Configuration and Power Interface)

        BIOS32 (BIOS32 Service Directory)

        PIR (PCI IRQ Routing)

        32OS (BIOS32 Extension, Compaq-specific)
         See ownership for a  Compaq  ownership  tag  retrieval
         tool.

        SNY (Sony-specific, not decoded)

        VPD (Vital Product Data, IBM-specific)
         Use vpddecode for a more detailed output.

        FJKEYINF (Application Panel, Fujitsu-specific)


       biosdecode  started  its life as a part of dmidecode but
       as more entry point types were added, if was moved to  a
       different program.


OPTIONS
       -d, --dev-mem FILE
              Read memory from device FILE (default: /dev/mem)

       -h, --help
              Display usage information and exit

       -V, --version
              Display the version and exit


FILES
       /dev/mem

BUGS
       Most of the time, biosdecode prints too much information
       (you don't really care about addresses)  or  not  enough
       (because  it  doesn't  follow pointers and has no lookup
       tables).
